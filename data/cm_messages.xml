<string id="698">Humans. &#10;The humans are the most populous race in Draconis. As the other races saw their rise and fall with the ages, man has steadily become more prominant and capable. Once underestimated, the humans now through numbers alone offer competition to the High Elf-Kin and the Dwarves. When their cleverness and adaptability is taken into account it is easy to see why the humans have managed to prolong their survival to reach this point of equality with the older races.  </string>
<string id="699">Elf-Kin. &#10;The elves are one of the oldest races to walk the shores of Draconis. Though any purebloods died over the last thousand years, vestiges of their magical prowess can be seen scattered across the realm. The Elf-Kin are the closest relatives to their famous ancestors. Born from generations of breeding with humans and other races, the High Elf-Kin are known for being intelligent and graceful, though their physical prowess is the weakest of the three races.</string>
<string id="700">Dwarves. &#10;As the undisputed masters of smith and stone, the dwarves have long held an envied position among the races of Draconis. Sturdier than both Humans and High Elf-Kin, they are found equally often as craftsmen and warriors. While primarily known for their halls in the mountains, the dwarves have moved to the surface over the course of the last several centuries. Today it is as common to see a Dwarf as it is to see a human.</string>

<string id="972">Don't forget to use "Observe" in the Artisan menu to help you plan your village and flatten ground before construction</string>
<string id="973">Uprooting a stump will unblock that part of the terrain for construction or for the growth of new trees</string>
<string id="974">You have just finished your first tiny shack, but it's still not yours! Claim it using your authority skill and then set it as your home spawn point via special general actions ability.</string>

<string id="976">Blunt damage is non lethal and will cause a knock out rather then death of a victim. A proper thug avoids killing!</string>

<string id="981">You need to literally hit your opponent with your weapon's damaging part. Getting too close to your oponent will cause you to miss your attacks. Learn the ideal range for your weapon and do your best to keep your enemy within this range.</string>
<string id="982">Formations are more effective when there are MORE unit members inside the formation</string>
<string id="983">Harvest sprouts and replant trees you chop down. Massive building projects can quickly deforest an area, resulting in problems for future construction and crafting.</string>
<string id="984">Mind the weather when you sow crops. Lack of sun and rain may lead to poor harvests.</string>
<string id="985">Flux, naphtha and flavors are special results of herbalism/alchemy used for advanced crafting and construction</string>
<string id="986">You can rearrange and add new abilities on your hotbar from a skill book in the UI customization mode (F10)</string>
<string id="987">Clay roads increase your movement speed by 10 %%. Stone paved ones — by 25%%.</string>
<string id="988">Swamps and snow can slow you down considerably. Avoid them if you are trying to run away from someone!</string>

<string id="1534" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your jaw is pierced by a jolt of horrendous pain. Those accursed toothworms! Once they start tossing and turning, gnawing on the meet of your tooth, you cannot help howling! You recollect seeing an itinerant healer pull a whole nest of worms out of a blackened tooth. Each of them was as big as an earthworm!</string>
<string id="1535" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a chill run down your spine. Someone must have walked over your grave just now. With great concern you think that you, too, will be buried deep underground. What could you take with you? "Let them see, even in the great beyond, that my heart is neither that of a coward or a miser, and that my life was lived with dignity. What will you put in the bark that takes me on my final voyage? A horse's bone? A hammer? Golden coins?"</string>
<string id="1536" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are seized by a suffocating cough. As you catch your breath, you are thinking that you should see a good healer at some point. They should be able to chase the demons away. The memory from a few winters ago, one of a healer lighting up a mixture of roots and herbs and making a great deal of smoke as a result, is still fresh in your mind. With your own eyes you saw serpentine spirits with no substance to their form leave your body.</string>
<string id="1537" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The mead of the gods is suddenly poured over you, and you stand still, awed by the amazing sound: "The gods have poured over their celestial chalice, lighting the amber of the cold earth in the middle."</string>
<string id="1538" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly stub your little toe. A strong piercing pain makes you pull one one leg and jump around on the other foot, as though you were a giant sparrow. You are enraged — your first impulse is to grab an axe, to chop off the swinish digit, and to throw it to the dogs!</string>
<string id="1539" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sneeze. You rummage in the folds of your garments for an amulet — may this not be an illness! Away with thee! May every illness and malady be gone from me!</string>
<string id="1540" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you trip and twist your foot. You carefully try to step on it and realize you won't get far. You cannot shift your weight onto your left foot — it hurts and is beginning to swell.</string>
<string id="1541" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden sting in a soft and private part of your anatomy. You begin to itch furiously, trying to reach and squash the revolting bloodsucker dining on your body.</string>
<string id="1542" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the air that you swallowed as you ate tear out of its confines and head outwards. That was some burp! Even more thunderous than the gods holding chariot races in their celestial domains!</string>
<string id="1543" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a terrible itch right in the middle of your back — the very spot your fingernails cannot reach. You grunt and writhe like an enormous overfed worm.</string>
<string id="1544" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You yawn with great gusto, opening your mouth wide. Then you realize something and quickly cover your mouth with the palm of your hand: there are all sorts of fiends waiting eagerly to mock a good man by entering his body through his open mouth.</string>
<string id="1545" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you feel a pain in your stomach. You clench your jaws. There are beads of sweat on your face. If only you had some crushed chicken stomachs right now… You'd surely feel better in an instant!</string>
<string id="1546" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are overcome by hiccups. You think that a fly must have flown into your stomach through your mouth and slap yourself on the belly to chase it out.</string>
<string id="1547" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you feel a strange emptiness inside — it appears to be in your stomach. Oh, to be back home again… Everyone used to have so much fun. Those feasts were so magnificent! No one would do any work for three days in a row. Everybody ate meat cooked in gigantic pots, drank heady ale, and sprinkled sacrificial blood all over the place. Ah, those halcyon days… Their memory is so dear to one's heart…</string>
<string id="1548" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly lose balance and start waving your arms around like a wounded duck. Your foot slips perfidiously, and you fall on your back. A dull pain confirms it: Mother Earth has given the back of your head a somewhat different shape after a mighty crash.</string>
<string id="1549" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You snort. You remember those filthy swines making obscene jokes about your mother. You replied slowly, with great emphasis: "How about you flap your backsides instead of your tongues?" and proceeded to send your fist right into the fattest one's mug. He instantly started snorting — he must have choked on the putrid liquid that had served him as blood.</string>
<string id="1550" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden chill. You turn around, but see no one behind you. You remember the tale of the Hobbler, who had his eye tied after his death and even dragged out through a hole in one of the walls, lest he remember the way back… Even though they fixed the hole later, Hobbler kept coming back to that house, doing away with most of those who lived in this area.</string>
<string id="1551" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Some salty sweat trickles down your nose and drops right onto your lips. You instantly recollect the glorious ancient custom of preserving your foes' heads in salt. You remember how your father brought a salted head back from one of his campaigns. Albeit an eye short, it was the most fascinating toy ever!</string>
<string id="1552" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel your blood rush to your ears and your sight darkening. You seem to notice a shape of a tall and mighty figure right in front of you. You would never reach its shoulders, even if you put all your kinfolk on top of each other. The nebulous figure slowly melted. What could it be? Was it just blood rushing to your head, or a warning from one of the gods?</string>
<string id="1553" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a chill and shiver. You might want to find some warmer clothes.</string>
<string id="1554" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You scratch your head, and your fingers catch a louse. You look at it and think that each of us is just like a louse in the hands of the gods. You can decide its fate just like they rule over our lives and deaths. This makes you equal to the gods. You squash the revolting creature with your fingernails with great relish.</string>
<string id="1555" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise a hand to scratch your nose and notice a knobbly wart sitting right between your fingers. An awkward place — you should get rid of it. You could find a mushroom and tie it to your hand. Or catch a grasshopper — their saliva can remove every fiendish growth from one's skin. You cannot pull the wart out, after all — their roots go all the way down to one's guts.</string>
<string id="1556" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You can hear the words often uttered by an old man you had once known: "All of yon business is most fascinating, but you might consider doing something worthy for once, me good lad."</string>
<string id="1557" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">There it is again! You get the feeling as if somebody was watching you.</string>
<string id="1558" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">For a brief moment, you can clearly feel that you are controlled by some unknown powers — as if you were not a master of your own fate, but a mere marionette in someone's skilled hands.</string>
<string id="1559" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you get a vision of someone's face in the air that surrounds you — it has a mean of great concern and seems vaguely familiar. You shake your head and look about yourself in alarm — but no, there is no one there…</string>
<string id="1560" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch your numb and weary shoulders. You feel like dropping everything, but you're not accustomed to quitting halfway, so you get back to work.</string>
<string id="1561" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden burning pain in your hand. You instantly jerk it back and notice bright green leaves of another species among the flat wide leaves of the apple tree. The poisonous parasite has caught you unawares. You know that already before dusk you will start itching like a mangy mutt, and there will be blisters on your skin.</string>
<string id="1562" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an unpleasant tingling in your neck. It is as if you had a hundred ants under your collar biting you. You shouldn't stare upwards for so long — your neck feels stiff and numb. You need a rest.</string>
<string id="1563" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A nice and crunchy apple falls down on your head. You head is ringing and you remember how you threw a rock at the Moon once, but it ended up falling to the ground and landing on an old dog. It was fun, but you still didn't feel gratified. Why don't rocks stay up in the sky? Things always end up falling down. There must be some sort of magic inside the Earth, after all. Or it might be the work of spirits of some sort.</string>
<string id="1564" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">An apple falls down on your head. The top of your head hurts and you smash your fist into the bark of the tree. The apple tree produces a crackling sound, and the rough bark scrapes your knuckles raw.</string>
<string id="1565" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly, a sharp branch pricks your hand. What could it be? You see a long gray splinter underneath your skin. You won't be able to get it out at once — you shall have to bear with it for a while and work with more care.</string>
<string id="1566" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You run your hand over the rough bark of the apple tree. The gray and scaly bark looks cracked like dry soil during a drought.</string>
<string id="1567" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cannot reach the apples that grow on the upper branches. You hit the tree to shake down the fruit. You remember that fallen apples get bruised and broken, so it's best to eat them at once.</string>
<string id="1568" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Old one-eye likes to tell tall tales about beautiful maidens who live in faraway lands and feed travelers with apples granting immortality. Or maybe it's their local god that feeds on nothing but magic apples. He should really pull the other one — we surely have nothing of the sort growing here.</string>
<string id="1569" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how a few years ago the snow stayed on the ground almost until the end of spring and how the frost has destroyed a great many trees. The Heavens were merciful this year, though, and the Goddess of Spring warmed the Earth up in time.</string>
<string id="1570" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The sun is pleasantly warm on your skin, and it makes the golden apples ripen. As you watch the apples growing a deeper yellow, you remember the tale of a magic chest with golden apples that belonged to the Goddess of Youth. They say that whoever tastes them will be granted eternal youth. It would sure be nice to lay your hands on a chest like that… You get lost in your daydream, losing your balance and falling off the tree as a result.</string>
<string id="1571" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a madman that turned up in your native village one day. He would shout that apples were the fruit of demons and that they should never be eaten. He claimed apples would draw the wrath of the Heavens down onto mankind. A large crowd had gathered around him. There was a great buzz, and then they stuffed his gob full of apples. He had tried to choke them down, but he died in the attempt. He must have spoken the truth — the wrath of Heavens smothered him.</string>
<string id="1572" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an unpleasant prickling in one of your fingers. You take a closer look at your palm, and see that a sharp twig has ripped your skin open. You'll have to wait a while before you can work with this hand.</string>
<string id="1573" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bury one of the fruit underneath the apple tree. This is your way of thanking the gods for a plentiful harvest and expressing a hope for their future benevolence.</string>
<string id="1574" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your grandfather saying, "Grass is best cut when it's wet with dew, and harvest is best gathered when it's dry." But it is one's hunger that chooses the best time for apples.</string>
<string id="1575" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice lots of yellowish fruit underneath the tree — someone must have scattered them by shaking the tree quite recently. Your mouth begins to water when you remember just how sweet and juicy they are — these must be the best apples around! You gather them into your bag, amazed by your luck.</string>
<string id="1576" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a large caterpillar on one of the apple tree leaves. You suddenly think of just how amazing the ways of nature are — this pitiful worm is born ugly, but rewarded with wings in the next life. Is there a happy transformation of the same sort awaiting you? You squash the caterpillar with your fingers in deep contemplation.</string>
<string id="1577" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a burning sensation on your neck. You slap your neck with your hand in annoyance and notice a squashed wasp. The little pest is dead, but it has left you its sting as a souvenir. You cringe as you rub the bite.</string>
<string id="1578" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a long white writhing creature gnawing its way into the hard ripe apple. You squash the worm with your fingers, recollecting the words of your mother: "You cannot fool worms — they always choose the best apples."</string>
<string id="1579" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see the work of the solar deity on one of the apples — a bleak print of a leaf. You are jubilant — it is a good sign! Your luck will surely change for the better now.</string>
<string id="1580" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It seems to you as though you see thin golden threads in the ground. You instantly remember the old legend of the God of the Netherworld who keeps his gold-haired daughter deep underground. If only you could manage to drag the girl out by her tresses, you'd end your days a wealthy man. The pickaxe rings as it hits the ground, and a cloud of dust covers your eyes. You rub them irritatedly — serious work has no place for idle daydreaming.</string>
<string id="1581" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe hits the ground. You seem to hear a muffled rumble somewhere in the depths. What could possibly hide there? Could the legends of the craftsmen from underground be true? Worldly-wise people say that underground folk lure skilled craftsmen and miners into their tunnels and hold them captive down there. Those who end up in their domain never see the light of day again.</string>
<string id="1582" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your lower back feels like it's breaking — you have pains and aches in your entire body. All you want is to lie down onto the ground and never rise again. Most importantly, don't bend your back — keep it as straight as you can. You have to do away with the bad habit of bowing — even to Mother Earth herself!</string>
<string id="1583" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Didn't you just see strange sparkles in the rock? It could be quartz, which means that there may be rare minerals nearby! You were right — a small but precious stone is now yours.</string>
<string id="1584" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You catch your breath, admiring the uncanny chipped spot. Whimsical lines form a delicate vegetative pattern. None of those grow on your land… These must be the pictures of underground forests and gardens.</string>
<string id="1585" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swing the pickaxe with force, but the hard ground suddenly resists you. The pickaxe gives a jolt and slaps your hands. You hear a cracking sound. There is a jagged crack that meanders its way up through the handle — the wood has proven too weak for your efforts.</string>
<string id="1586" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe feel like an extension of your body, and you resiliently dig your way in, fused together like a magical amphisbaena. The earth moans and clenches its muscles, resisting your invasion. You feel a sharp pain — the fingers of your right hand lose their grip. You might have guessed — a dislocated joint. The Earth wins this battle against you.</string>
<string id="1587" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe enters the soft ground smoothly; like a knife through butter. But, alas, your joy is premature — your instrument gets stuck, as if caught in a vise. You give it a jerk, and another one...Got it! It seems the heavy head will stay underground forever — all you have in your hand is the handle!</string>
<string id="1588" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You give the pickaxe a wide swing and plunge it into the ground — but it hits a rock and swings back! You hear a sharp, metallic clang, and suddenly you're seeing stars right before your eyes! Well, even a bull would have been knocked out from such a blow from a pickaxe handle!</string>
<string id="1589" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop to catch your breath and study the excavated soil. It bears an uncanny resemblance to the apple pie your dear mother would bake on Sundays. This part is like a layer of dough, and that one is just like the fragrant apples inside. With a generous portion of thick cream right on top. Perhaps, the dwarf folk that live underground know the art of baking pies, too?</string>
<string id="1590" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">There's an unpleasant stinging sensation in your palm. You examine your left hand and you see blisters that have formed on the rough ridges of your palm. Some of them have burst, with blood smeared all across the grubby skin. You spit with great rancor, then tear a piece of cloth off your sleeve and bandage your palm.</string>
<string id="1591" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swing your pickax and suddenly feel a resemblance to a none-too-bright bird — one that had never managed to learn to fly and awkwardly flaps its fingers in its pathetic attempts to become airborne. You seem to feel short of breath — you might want to catch a breather.</string>
<string id="1592" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel as though you have caught the rhythm of Mother Earth herself. You hit with your pickaxe, and it answers with a muffled thud. The rhythm of this laborious underground music seems to reverberate through your entire body, which also feels like it's ringing. Suddenly, a heavy rock hits you in the jaw. It is beginning to swell. A hard blow to punish your overconfidence.</string>
<string id="1593" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You contemplate the hardships of a miner's labor; it must be hard to dig right in front of you. What if you have to dig further down? An unstable, treacherous slope that threatens to crumble at any moment, while a sack of rocks is nearly breaking your back.</string>
<string id="1594" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You get the notion that it would be nice to build an entire city underground. With squares joined by streets, and also roads for horses and carts. It may be easier to move around when you are underground — no woods or rivers to hinder you. You check yourself irritatedly. Where do these wild fancies come from? Sometimes the visions sent by the gods are outright ridiculous.</string>
<string id="1595" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your watering eyes suddenly notice a reddish vein deep in the rock. This is how they find gold — right next to the copper! You hit away with your pickaxe, only to realize you were wrong. It was a mere waste of time and effort.</string>
<string id="1596" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe suddenly rebounds from the hard and rocky ground, striking sparks and a host of small pebbles out of the rock you hit. Your hand jerks toward your right eye — a sharp pain lets you know that one of the pebbles hit you right in the eye.</string>
<string id="1597" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Were there any cases of good people digging the ground diligently, only to fall through and end up in the halls of the God of the Netherworld? No such story has ever been told — the Earth must be truly deep.</string>
<string id="1598" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">They say there are mysterious beings living in such hills. Their children are slow to grow, so they sometimes swap them for human babies. You think you knew one of those changelings — he looked just like one of the underground folk.</string>
<string id="1599" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Sometimes you find yourself thinking that it may be cozier underground. It is as if you were closer to Mother Earth's gigantic heart — and sometimes you get the feeling you can hear it beat.</string>
<string id="1600" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Another strike, and then another! No use. You think it's just your luck to have come across the dwelling of the Álfar, the underground folk! Their craftsmen can make gates that will resist a celestial hammer, let alone a mere pickaxe!</string>
<string id="1601" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a smell coming from the soil. It is that special musty odor of roots searching for nutrient juices underground, old rotten leaves, and sweet luscious saplings. The smell of life itself.</string>
<string id="1602" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your back and knead a ball of earth in your hands. It is cold and moist. It crumbles in your hands with a sweet aroma of tree roots.</string>
<string id="1603" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your back, feeling a dull pain in its lower part. Your hands are still clenching the handle of your spade, but you freeze, amazed by the thought that Mother Earth doesn't only feed you — she also takes things away. She provides you with food and shelter, but someday she will take away it all, including yourself. A mean and malicious deity…</string>
<string id="1604" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your spade slices an earthworm in two. You recollect the time when you saw your half-witted neighbors drop those creatures on the ground in hopes they would till it with their bodies. The kids from all around the place brought those crackpots a bunch of snakes from the forest. Snakes are much better for tilling, after all. You rub the scar behind your ear, which reminds you of your neighbors' ingratitude.</string>
<string id="1605" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pummel away at the soil. With each strike the spade tears into the insides of the earth — its wounds glisten with moisture and vapors as if they were bleeding. You pretend to be a mighty warrior who knows no defeat. Even though you may have a spade instead of a shiny sword. May the stronger opponent win.</string>
<string id="1606" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your spade stops halfway, as if the soil had gotten denser. You scatter the soil with your foot. Indeed, your instrument may as well have been caught in the tentacles of an octopolus. These tough tree roots won't let you go deeper into the flesh of the Earth. It takes you a lot of effort to unearth those pesky roots.</string>
<string id="1607" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the spade give a jerk in your hands. There is a short clang and a sudden cracking sound. You pull the spade out of the soil and see that your worst suspicious were true — the spade smashed into a rock, and the handle got broken at the very head.</string>
<string id="1608" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sudden pain above the knee gives you a jolt and makes you throw down your spade. You turn around quickly and see your foe — the narrow dusty body of a snake crawling away. Your are furious and throw a stone into the escaping reptile. But you a more important problem than revenge — you are beginning to feel the effects of the venom.</string>
<string id="1609" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You shovel the soil away and notice the long red bodies of earthworms. You think that these pitiful creatures also have their uses, even though they are deaf and blind to everything. Skilled healers use them for treating eye diseases, burns, insomnia, and headaches.</string>
<string id="1610" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You imagine there is treasure somewhere near. Your hard and monotonous labor is suddenly painted in the golden hues of found treasure. The pebbles that hit the metal feel like coins. Just in case, you banish the spirits guarding the treasure: "Begone, it was not you who had put it there, so it is not for you to take!"</string>
<string id="1611" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your back to wipe the sweat off your brow and see a raven take off. Its loud cawing can be heard for miles around. You are wondering whether it could be one of the ancient god's spies bearing tidings.</string>
<string id="1612" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an ache in your lower back. You try to straighten, but you barely manage it. You feel as if someone had stuck a hundred daggers into your back. You remember how your mother would make some sour dough and then wrap it around father like a belt. But you need peace and quiet. You rest on the spade and try to catch your breath.</string>
<string id="1613" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a narrow gray wire crawl past you. A snake! You stay motionless and wait for the dangerous reptile to crawl away. You wipe what feels like a gallon of cold sweat from your brow and kiss the little white pebble — the enchanted charm that wards against snakes has proven its utility yet again.</string>
<string id="1614" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The spade gives a sudden jerk in your hand and goes sideways. You feel a sharp pain in your right eye, which instantly fills with tears. A solid piece of rocky earth that you hadn't noticed broke when you hit it with your spade, and one of the shards hurts your eye.</string>
<string id="1615" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your spade makes a clinking sound as it hits something. You bend down and unearth a flat disk out of a dull yellow metal with elaborate carvings. Looks like a brooch. Who could have lost it here?</string>
<string id="1616" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect the tales of your forefathers about their battles for the land. They used to chase away peasants and everybody else. The most hated enemies would have their backs hacked open and their lungs extracted through the freshly-cut openings… Fierce times by any account!</string>
<string id="1617" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how nice it would be to find some buried treasure. But whoever has heard anything of buried treasure being found in our days? People are no fools — everybody tries to hide their valuables as deep and as far away as they can. For a militant god has ordered it for every warrior slain in battle to enter his hall bearing all of their wealth. No matter whether they are buried or cremated of a funeral pyre.</string>
<string id="1618" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You drive the entire head of the spade into the soil, and pull out a huge chunk of earth. You recollect stories of how the whole surface of the land can get covered with such cracks, thousands of feet deep. Mother Earth opens her maw and swallows people, animals, and houses all at once.</string>
<string id="1619" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that digging by itself isn't that hard. Had there be trees here, you would have to do three to four times as much work! After all, there would be trees to burn and chop down, as well as roots to unearth. A great way to break your back, to be sure!</string>
<string id="1620" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sharp gust of wind catches you unawares — it playfully raises a cloud of dust and tosses some sand into your face. You have a mouthful of grit, your eyes itch and slam shut. You wipe off the tears with the back of your hand.</string>
<string id="1621" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The heavy and heady odor of animal habitation rushes up your nostrils like an attacking army. You inhale the air, sniffing loudly — you like the feeling of warmth and security that this smell associates with.</string>
<string id="1622" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your eyes — they are still unaccustomed to the half-light inside. The light that manages to get in through the open door is manifestly insufficient.</string>
<string id="1623" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a wide step to avoid a pile of manure and trip over a floorboard. You barely manage to keep your balance and imagine smashing the pesky piece of wood to smithereens as you rub your hurt leg.</string>
<string id="1624" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You smash right into a beam on the ceiling of the shed, and an incandescent flame flares up inside your head. You rub the hurt place forcefully, methodically taking in vain the names of all gods from the very creation in succession, as well as those of their mothers, offspring, and close kin.</string>
<string id="1625" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You decide to catch a breather and put your instrument aside. You look at yourself, thinking you're a right pig. Getting those clothes clean again will be no mean feat. There's also dust and pieces of straw stuck to the manure…</string>
<string id="1626" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You enjoy work in the shed. Some turn their noses up at such jobs as these since they consider them messy. However, you perceive it as a manifestation of the very cycle of life — nothing ever disappears without a trace. Grass and corn transform into manure, which provides nutrition to the next year's grass. An amazing wheel that keeps on turning.</string>
<string id="1627" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Fresh manure — particularly when it's still warm and not quite dry — can be used in a variety of entertaining ways! For example, you can put it in a bucket and hang it over a neighbor's door. The simpleton will step out and get a warm and fragrant shower. I swear he'll just stand there blinking his eyes. Although that might lead to a real row between neighbors. Or maybe not.</string>
<string id="1628" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at manure and think of all the people who just throw it away. But manure has lots of uses — it's not just a fertilizer. When it's dry and hard, it can heal all the aches in your joints.</string>
<string id="1629" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your nose catches a delicate and barely felt odor of smoke. It's always pleasant and reliable — it means there is a human dwelling nearby, where you can find food and a place to warm up.</string>
<string id="1630" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The warm and dense air of the shed has wrapped you in a solid cocoon. It is so saturated with odors that it feels as though you could cut it with a knife.</string>
<string id="1631" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You come to your senses too late when you notice a gray ball in one of the corners. The ball unfurls in an instant and attacks you. You fail to avoid the sudden attack and receive a sharp bite. There is a poisoned swelling growing right under your knee.</string>
<string id="1632" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You step on the warm manure that was hay and grain as recently as an hour ago and slip forward like a young maiden on ice. Falling on ice is just as painful, but nowhere near as horribly messy. You get up groaning, wiping grimy hands on your clothes.</string>
<string id="1633" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You get to business eagerly and productively, completely unprepared for a horrible affront. Your spade slips, and the moist slippery mass hits you right in the face with considerable force. It's a good job no one has seen it!</string>
<string id="1634" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your eyes adapt to the half-light, and you notice something out of the ordinary. You bend and pick up a shining iridescent feather. You are wondering whether it might be a good omen from the gods, in which case you should keep the feather as a talisman. But what if it's an evil sorcery and has to be burned and scattered to the four winds?</string>
<string id="1635" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look up and see a gray ball in one of the corners, right underneath the ceiling. You poke it with your spade, only to recognize it as a wasp nest the next instant. Too late — the angry buzzing swarm has already come out in search of the trespasser. You cover your face and run! However, you are already beginning to feel the wasps' burning attacks — the bites instantly swell up in ugly itchy blotches.</string>
<string id="1636" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look up and see a gray ball in one of the corners, right underneath the ceiling. You are about to poke it with your spade when you realize it to be a bird's nest. The swallows must have built themselves a home. You decide to let them live — swallows bring good luck.</string>
<string id="1637" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop for a moment and listen to the ceaseless bustle of animal habitation. The wood creaks under gusts of wind and footsteps. The birds converse sleepily. Something rustles, someone breathes, and the delicate aroma of hay permeates everything…</string>
<string id="1638" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look about you and think it would be nice to get some twigs for the animals — fresh leaves and bark are always good for them.</string>
<string id="1639" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a rustle behind you. There is no one there. Or so it seems. But is it noon, when you can see a household spirit? What if the spirit is angry and demands order and cleanliness? It might be a good idea to placate it with some porridge with lots of butter.</string>
<string id="1640" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice that the southern beams gather more moisture on them. You sigh — at this rate, mildew and rot are not far behind. You probably need to coat the wood with tar.</string>
<string id="1641" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You run your hand over the log. Just as you had thought — the wood bugs have gnawed a bunch of streets and lanes inside it. The wood will eventually rot completely, and the other logs will suffer the same fate! It's like a plague! Would rubbing linen oil all over it do the trick?</string>
<string id="1642" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What you need to know in this business is where to stick your knife. If it's a bird, you don't have to think much. Chop off the head, and that's it. Larger animals can be tricky. First you need to stun them and then feel for the exact position of the heart. That's where the knife goes. The most important thing is to keep it sharp.</string>
<string id="1643" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sacrifice to the gods would be in order. The boss isn't a great fan of domestic animals — he should be given a wolf or a dog, of course. The rest can get a burnt offering of a heart and a liver when the hour is right.</string>
<string id="1644" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are satisfied with your knife. What matters most in your business is to have a pair of skillful hands and a sharp blade. Neither of them have let you down. With a knife like this, cutting meat will be child's play — it could cut wood like butter!</string>
<string id="1645" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You inopportunely recollect how one of the villagers tried to chop off a rooster's neck without due care — that rooster wandered about the yard for a few days after that. Of course, it could neither eat, nor mate with hens. Crowing was also out of the question, since there was nothing left to crow with. The rooster attracted crowds of gawkers. When it finally died, they burned the carcass. No one felt like eating it.</string>
<string id="1646" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cautiously enter the half-lit building. After all, you remember how one of those accursed ferrets stole all your chickens once, leaving nothing but feathers behind. They say that these days they see wolves right near human dwellings. And those are after larger prey. You think it would be best to slay all your livestock instead — bursting seems more appealing than giving the wolf so much as a single chunk of meat.</string>
<string id="1647" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You admire your animals contentedly — they surely look good. The gods must be well pleased. You remember how the neighbors' cow gave birth to a two-headed calf once. It may be curious, but it's a very ill omen.</string>
<string id="1648" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember the horrendous pestilence from a few years back, when few owners had any livestock left. They still talk about it, claiming the pestilence was brought by the wind. But you know for sure that a witch was to blame. You know this stuff better than most.</string>
<string id="1649" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a look at the roof beams — there is a skillfully-woven wreath of twigs bearing mystical symbols hanging right above the entrance. People say that such talismans are failsafe — if you have one of those, no pest or plague can ever hurt your livestock and poultry.</string>
<string id="1650" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at your livestock and poultry thinking you've seen better-looking specimens. The chickens could be better-fed, and the cows could be plumper. You wonder where you could find a special spell to aid the situation.</string>
<string id="1651" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Chicken soup is pretty good, of course, and the same goes for pork soup. But the best kind of pottage is made from fat saltwater fish. Those slices of pink flesh, that broth with golden drops of oil — if that isn't food of the gods, I don't know what is!</string>
<string id="1652" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it would be nice to roast a whole carcass someday. Just put it on a spit and place it over the fire. Such feasts could last for days on end, and no guests would leave. Of course, you cannot have a feast without ale — that's the best thing to wash down the meat.</string>
<string id="1653" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You clean the knife with a handful of straw and look at the skinned carcass, recalling your dear mother's cooking with a fair bit of nostalgia. No one could cook pork like she did! She would add sour cream and dump in some herbs. The smell would make everyone's mouth water — even people from the neighboring village!</string>
<string id="1654" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sharply swing your killing implement, but what could be the matter with you today? The blade has chosen the wrong victim and sliced off one of your fingers! You throw the failed sacrificial victim away and grab the stub with your other hand. You'll have to sear the wound with hot iron.</string>
<string id="1655" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall communal feasts where whole mounds of meat would be served. Boiled meat, roast mean, and all kinds of fish. Everyone would bring whatever they had in their pantries. And, of course, rivers — nay, whole oceans — of beer. A feast without beer is like a man without a beard.</string>
<string id="1656" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You flinch as you bandage yourself with a piece of torn cloth, grimacing as you observe beads of blood forming where you pressed your blade to your finger. You definitely sharpened the blade well!</string>
<string id="1657" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up the offal and feel something solid inside. You slice the slippery knot with your knife, and something shiny falls onto your palm. You rub it clean and take a closer look…</string>
<string id="1658" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The animal's body no longer convulses in your hands  —  it has gone quiet and limp. You see the ground absorb the black steaming blood. You feel as if you are watching life itself leave the body.</string>
<string id="1659" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are weary and exhausted. The accursed animal refuses to let you catch it, making you run around like mad. You feel as though you ran through all nine worlds. You stop to catch a breath. You are red with fury — you feel like strangling the pesky creature with your own two hands.</string>
<string id="1660" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Amazing  —  the animal has no idea of the fate that's about to befall it. But do any of us know that about ourselves? Neither you, nor me. No one can see into their own future…</string>
<string id="1661" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Satisfied, you feel the weight of the fruits of your labor in your hands. You think it would be great to trade some of it for household utensils if an itinerant trader happened to pass by.</string>
<string id="1662" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">While your eyes adjust to the warm half-light, you recollect the tale about someone's hen laying golden eggs. Wouldn't it be nice to rummage in the hay with your hand and find a few smooth and heavy eggs made of pure gold…</string>
<string id="1663" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are satisfied with your "haul." As you leave, your foot trips over a floorboard that pops up all of a sudden, and you come crashing down  —  just like an oak struck by one of the Red-Bearded God's lightning bolts. Your hands are empty again, as if you had only just entered.</string>
<string id="1664" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You make sure the "haul" sits tight under your arm lest you drop it, thinking it would be nice to churn the milk into butter, adding enough salt for long-term storage.</string>
<string id="1665" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wipe your hands with some hay and think it would be really great to drink some buttermilk right about now. Milk is very good for you, of course, but no one drinks it raw, after all! You either need to bring it to a boil, or use it to make some buttermilk.</string>
<string id="1666" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What you like most is going to the shed on your own. The elders were right  —  another one's eye is always an ill omen. If someone sets out to accompany you when you milk a cow, shear a sheep, or even pick eggs out of the hay, everything will end up going to waste.</string>
<string id="1667" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your tired back, but it's a pleasant sort of tiredness. You rub your lower back and inhale the warm and spicy aroma of old hay, wet wool, and fermented manure.</string>
<string id="1668" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Having finished your task, you look about yourself. Before you leave, you think that you should bring some twigs tomorrow  —  they will freshen the odor with some woody notes, and it's always good for the animals to chew on some greens.</string>
<string id="1669" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are about to leave. However, since all you think of is how not to drop what you are carrying, you fail to duck in time. The low-hanging lintel seems to strike a whole bunch of sparks out of your forehead. They could probably burn down the entire shed! You feel your forehead gingerly  —  a huge lump is beginning to grow there.</string>
<string id="1670" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">As you finish your work, you decide to sacrifice some of it to the gods  —  they will surely appreciate it. Then they will be benevolent to you once more.</string>
<string id="1671" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You leave the shed, carrying the fruits of your labor in your hands with great care. You keep thinking of what needs to be done first. Maybe you should make some yogurt out of the milk. Or, perhaps, start processing the wool  —  it needs to be carded and degreased.</string>
<string id="1672" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You exit the shed, bent not so much by your heavy load, but rather the weight of everything that troubles you  —  you remember that the old weight for the spinning-wheel has rolled away, and that now you need to shape another rock into a disk.</string>
<string id="1673" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carefully step over the floorboard that sticks up, mindful of your load, and think that some madder would come in handy. You could use it to dye the newly-sheared wool bright red  —  the most festive color of them all.</string>
<string id="1674" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You brush away the dust and hay and are about to leave. You think it would be a good idea to stock up on wool. You recall what your dear mother has taught you  —  to dye wool red, you use a special herb. To dye it brown, you need some lichens, and if you want to dye it black, get some of that swamp mud that smells like iron.</string>
<string id="1675" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carry your load to the exit, contemplating just how amazing the world is.  A mere sheep gives you wool, which is then spun by the women into modest twill fabric, which is sometimes worth its weight in silver. And the stupid hens, which are hardly even considered proper birds, can lay eggs. And if you're hungry, an egg is like a plateful of silver and gold!</string>
<string id="1676" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stare into the depths of the water tensely. Is that the dark body of a fish moving close to the surface? Or a god's eye traded for a gulp of water from the Lake of Wisdom?</string>
<string id="1677" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">At last you got something with your fishing rod! You pull. The rod bends, but doesn't break. Another effort, and a dark object flies out of the water, as if catapulted. You grab it hastily… but what you find in your hands is but a wet piece of cloth with a pattern still recognizable on it. Someone must have drowned their banner here.</string>
<string id="1678" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You seem to have caught something truly heavy. You cannot pull your catch out of the water  —  it feels as though it's a whale at the very least. And this whale seems to be very reluctant to leave its native element. You wade in the water, bend over and try to disentangle your hook from a snag  —  slimy, but still sturdy enough.</string>
<string id="1679" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You deftly catch the fish and grab it by the tail. You stare at the strange creature, wondering what it might possibly be. It has spikes above its eyes, its fins are splayed out, and its eyes are as yellow as a snake's. You spit in disgust, and also trying to protect yourself from evil spirits, and throw the revolting creature as far into the water as you can.</string>
<string id="1680" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wait for something to bite and recollect how a few springs ago a gigantic fish was caught in a river during a flood  —  a real monster it was! They say it was a hundred feet long, and its head was used to make a cart. The whole village was eating fish soup until the very Autumn Sacrifice feast.</string>
<string id="1681" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">They say some lakes have no fish in them at all. One day a monster turns up and ends up devouring every living thing in the water. Then it sticks out its long neck and looks far away. Probably looking for another lake. Or, maybe, looking for something to eat on the shore.</string>
<string id="1682" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a soft splash. You hope fervently it isn't water spirits! Those girls have sweet faces, but they are way too mischievous. They can tickle you blue, and then drown you in deep water. Then you'll have to shepherd the underwater herds…</string>
<string id="1683" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The fishing rod gives a light jerk, and you pull it out with ease. What you see on the hook is a mangy little fish that even a cat wouldn't find appetizing. You don't want it, either. You take it off the hook and throw it in the water.</string>
<string id="1684" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The cool water with ripples on its surface beckons you to wash away the fatigue. You put your feet in with delight. The water embraces your feet and rocks them gently.</string>
<string id="1685" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">When you're near the water, you feel calm and quiet joy the most vividly. Soft babbling, rhythmic splashes, and sparkling ripples on the surface seem to connect you to the celestial city with long invisible threads.</string>
<string id="1686" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You enter the water knee-deep to cast your line farther. A few moments later you see narrow black pods stuck to your bare ankles. You come ashore and tear the leeches off your feet. Thin crimson trickles mix with the water that runs down your ankles, becoming more transparent. It may even have been good for you to let out some bad blood.</string>
<string id="1687" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wade in the water in order to free your hook from the snag. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain — as if a dog with a hundred heads had grabbed your foot with its jaws. You get your foot out of the water and try to wrest the beetle away from your wet skin. This hell's spawn is a true curse for anyone who likes to swim.</string>
<string id="1688" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a wide swing to sink your line, but loose your footage and fall flat on your face. You hit your stomach, which rings like an empty barrel hit with a fist. You feel a tight knot in your stomach that doesn't let you take a breath. You bend in half and forget about fishing for a while.</string>
<string id="1689" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swing your fishing rod, and the hook sinks right into your clothes. You try to untangle it, but you only have eyes in front of you. You cannot see what's happening behind your back, and your fingers lack the dexterity needed to catch the metallic tooth. You say a few strong words about the fishing rod, the hook, and the fisherman who has managed to catch himself.</string>
<string id="1690" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see concentric ripples on the water. You stare into them until your eyes begin to hurt. It might be a large fish playing. Or could it be a water spirit with several heads? You swear you won't touch any of his gold coins even if they torture you! If you do, you shall become a slave in the underwater world forever.</string>
<string id="1691" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You nimbly pull out the line, but your catch doesn't please you — it's but a clump of ill-smelling water vegetation. You irritatedly rip the wet aquatic plants off the hook when you feel a sharp sting — as if you were stung by a wasp. Soon you see a large crimson drop roll down the pricked finger.</string>
<string id="1692" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cast the line and think that freshwater fish are nice, of course. But seawater fish are both fatter and sweeter. Just to imagine a sea fish sizzling on the coals, dripping with clear juices… Freshwater fish can have the stale smell of still water and slimy duckweed.</string>
<string id="1693" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You gently pull a large and heavy fish out of the water, taking care not to let it slip away. Finally it's on the shore, slapping the ground wetly. You grab it with your hands, but the slimy scales slip right out of your fingers. Then you leap to cover the fish with your belly, but it is full of vigor, as if it were under some spell. One last hurl, and it returns into the water. You remain sitting on the shore, breathing hoarsely and heavily.</string>
<string id="1694" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You keep your eyes on the still surface of the water, without stirring once — as though you were a stone effigy. Not a single rustle. Not a single movement. All of a sudden, two magpies chasing each other filled the air with their deafening chatter. It is as if the air itself became filled with reverberations. That's it, then — it will be a while before a fish bites your bait.</string>
<string id="1695" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that walls are good protection from foes, no doubt. But you gladly recall the words of a great leader whose battlefield feats remain unsurpassed to this day: "The sturdiest wall is a wall of warriors. Nothing offers better defense than valor and bravery."</string>
<string id="1696" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember hearing of a wondrous dwelling built around an enormous tree. The tree towered far above the roof, and was covered in amazing blossoms. The dwelling resembled all nine worlds, with the tree at its axis. And the nine worlds, in turn, resembled this miraculous dwelling.</string>
<string id="1697" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You know one thing for certain — before you enter your new home, you must let a cat, a rooster, or a dog get in before you. A hen will work, too. After all, it is common knowledge that whoever enters a new dwelling first will also be the first to die.</string>
<string id="1698" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the house and recollect the old tradition of hanging deer antlers on the wall. This has been done since times immemorial. They keep evil spirits at bay.</string>
<string id="1699" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wonder whose blood was used to build this house. You can, of course, skip the sacrifice, but just how long will such a house stand? The foundation stone must by all means be bathed in the hot blood of a living being.</string>
<string id="1700" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think there must be something special about the walls of your home — they suffice for support in any endeavor. When you are home, you are at your strongest, and no wonders of faraway lands can match the magic power conferred to you by the walls of your own home.</string>
<string id="1701" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think about the warmth of a hearth. Campfires and the blazing furnaces of lavish palaces can warm the body, but only the hearth of your home can warm the soul.</string>
<string id="1702" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What else do you need if you have a house of your own? A bright fire in the fireplace and a bowl of porridge for the household spirits. If you placate them properly, rest assured that your dwelling will prosper!</string>
<string id="1703" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that a home is always much more than just the walls. It is the real heart of a family — a warm living thing. It ties all the roads and paths walked by father and son, grandfather and grandson, into a single knot. This is whence all your roads begin. This is also where they end, gods willing.</string>
<string id="1704" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that the first thing you will do when you enter the house is draw a wheel on every wall. It is the eternal symbol of life and the sun, and it grants your dwelling good fortune and prosperity.</string>
<string id="1705" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember the story of how one cunning villager built himself a house. He didn't want to dig in order for the nearby brook to come closer to his house. He built his dwelling right over that brook, no less. He used stones to fashion a drain and made a cover to go on top, and there was a brook running right through his hall!</string>
<string id="1706" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of just how often one's fate makes one search for a new home far away from your homeland. When a boy sees his twelfth winter and becomes a man, he has to set forth in search of fame and fortune. Then he has to build a home of his own. And how many of them built a home next to that of their father?</string>
<string id="1707" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your father, who claimed that even porridge was thicker at home. He was absolutely right!</string>
<string id="1708" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your dear mother would always get angry when one of the brothers would start dreaming of foreign lands. "It is a silly bird that resents its own nest," she'd say.</string>
<string id="1709" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You realize that you love your home just because it is yours — not because of its great size or wealth.</string>
<string id="1710" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it wouldn't hurt to express your gratitude for shelter to the household deities and to ask them for their patronage.</string>
<string id="1711" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly realize you are weary of roaming the land. Now that you have walls of your own to shelter you, a mere straw mattress will seem softer than a bed of feathers. And an unleavened bread that is your own tastes better than other people's pies.</string>
<string id="1712" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall the words of your grandfather, who would say, "The walls at home are your friends and helping hands." Indeed — they will protect you well against evil spirits and people alike.</string>
<string id="1713" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think how peculiar it is that each house has a smell of its own. It is born of the aroma of food that is cooked here and the breathing of its inhabitants, spiced up by the smoke of the hearth and warmed by the cozy smell of stones and logs that the house was constructed of.</string>
<string id="1714" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a hollow in the tree trunk. It appears to be the resting place of an owl that sleeps the day away. You feel a chill run down your spine — an encounter with this unclean bird bodes ill.</string>
<string id="1715" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and at its knotty branches, and note that they resemble the crooked fingers of an old man, always eager to slap your face — or even poke out an eye.</string>
<string id="1716" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the rough bark of the tree and notice cracks in it, which resemble narrow paths. You trace one such path with your finger — like a dry riverbed, it joins another, and together they run upwards, towards the canopy.</string>
<string id="1717" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look up and marvel at how large the canopy is. Leaves of this size would keep you dry even in the most furious of thunderstorms. Then you chuckle at your idea: imagine carrying such leaves around with you just in case it rains — like portable covers of sorts.</string>
<string id="1718" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You prod at a piece of loose bark with your fingernail — you can sometimes find fat white maggots underneath. They're ugly things, but they can save a starving person from death.</string>
<string id="1719" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push aside a branch that's right in your face, and you instantly notice an angry striped creature approach with an annoying buzz. You try to wave it aside, but the wasp is more agile than you. It drives its poisoned dagger smack into your right eyelid.</string>
<string id="1720" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a suspicious rustle in the leaves and jump aside, just in case. No, you must have imagined it. Everything appears to be in order. Those little red ticks wait ever so eagerly for the moment they can rain upon you from the leaves. They can get underneath your skin before you finish stripping frantically.</string>
<string id="1721" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something that resembles a gray knot amidst the branches. You pull the branch closer and see it is a construction woven haphazardly out of twigs, with three small dapple eggs in the middle. Well, they'll do you for a snack.</string>
<string id="1722" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push the branch away and feel as though someone had scattered tiny beads underneath the fabric of your clothes. You rub your body in surprise, only to find your skin begin to itch and burn horribly! Little black ants only look harmless. But they bite like horseflies.</string>
<string id="1723" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push aside the branches that hang too close to your face, and rip the skin on your finger open on a sharp twig. You attempt to quench the flame of pain and inadvertently pop your finger into your mouth. You furiously tear off the offending twig with the fingers of your other hand.</string>
<string id="1724" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place your palm on the rough bark, thinking that this tree's whole history can be found underneath the bark. Lean years and fat ones, dry and rainy summers — they are all here, drawn in uneven magical circles around the pith of the tree. But a tree can only tell its story when it dies.</string>
<string id="1725" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull a branch before you, but it's so thin and brittle it cracks. The light open wound emits a harsh and somewhat bitter odor. It reminds you the days in your parental home, when springtime filled the air with thousands of new smells, calling everyone to drink in the heady air. It also commanded everyone to take care of a myriad urgent things — on the land, in the woods…</string>
<string id="1726" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a close look at the tree, and, reassured, use your fingernails to pry something loose from the bark. You rub a small disk clean and recognize it to be a small silver brooch — the kind used by women to fasten their clothes on their chest. Someone must have stuck one to a tree for fun. Or could it be to mark the tree where they hid a cache of treasure?</string>
<string id="1727" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png"></string>
<string id="1728" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and recall the first lessons you received from your father. He said that a soil that is loose and paltry will make a tree grow feeble. A soil that is too moist makes trees grow scraggly, for the water chases all the air away from the roots, and they have nothing to breath with. But rich and loamy soil will make a tree grow tall and shapely.</string>
<string id="1729" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that mighty trees are like mighty warriors. They spread their branches majestically, looking the sun right into the eye without a shade of fear. Thin and feeble trees are cowards hiding behind mighty trunks or lurking well away from the center of the battlefield.</string>
<string id="1730" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push the branches apart, but one of them refuses to obey, slips out and slaps you right in the face. You feel an unbearable burning pain in your eyes, and tears run down your cheek, large as beans. You decide to take a short break.</string>
<string id="1731" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your head up and try to find the place where the tree meets the firmament. You imagine the tree of life, passing through the heavens of all the universes in a similar manner, with world upon world stacked on it.</string>
<string id="1732" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull one of the branches down, but it breaks all of a sudden, and its other end hits you right in the face. You didn't expect such impudence, and now you feel your cheek swelling up painfully. You know that the still dark blood will mark the place where you were hit for a long time, and remind of its existence with dull pain.</string>
<string id="1733" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and imagine it to be an old troll, who tries to deceive you and lure you near. You get lost in your daydream, and for a moment it seems to you as though the troll was really trying to reach its mossy and knobbly arm — or branch — toward you.</string>
<string id="1734" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You whisper and mumble old nursery rhymes in a matter-of-fact manner. It seems as though an adult shouldn't believe in children's tales. On the other hand, they always come in handy. What if you really manage to placate the little spirits of the forest, and they will reward you by revealing the best trees in their forest?</string>
<string id="1735" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull long white roots out of the loamy soil. They are succulent and crunchy, and your mouth feels with a sweet juice. The only unpleasant sensation is caused by the gritty soil on your teeth.</string>
<string id="1736" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice small yellow flowers surrounded by long narrow leaves. It must be the sundrop — and sometimes they taste as sweet as honey!</string>
<string id="1737" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull out a green sapling with a dirty white tangle of roots hanging underneath. You place them on your palm, and marvel at how the plant appears to have two heads. However, one of them faces Heaven, and the other, the Earth. Like a reflection in a pond.</string>
<string id="1738" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your fingers are now impossible to tell from roots — they are covered in soil, with dirt in every skin crease and under every fingernail. You stretch out your fingers and it feels as though you have swapped your hands for a troll's paws.</string>
<string id="1739" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place the root you have found in your mouth, but your face cringes — the taste in your mouth is as bitter as if you had just stuffed your mouth full of ashes from a funeral pyre. You spit, but the revolting taste seems to have etched itself into your mouth, and your face remains screwed up, with creases resembling the leg of an old boot.</string>
<string id="1740" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub the dirt away with your hands and pop the root into your mouth. The root is old and tough, and its fibers part with the greatest reluctance. Your jaws work like millstones to chew them up properly.</string>
<string id="1741" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You curse the kind of life that has made you gather those pitiful roots like some sort of a wild beast. You get worked up even more, comparing yourself to a blind mole or a slimy earthworm. But there's a void in your stomach that demands to be filled.</string>
<string id="1742" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You mumble a few prayers to the gods of fertility. If you cannot get any decent food, surely they won't begrudge you a few pathetic edible roots in their mercy?</string>
<string id="1743" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your mother, who could easily tell which herb was which, and also knew how to use them. She used to say that swamp crops can be found on damp soil — in swamps and on flood plains. Rhubarb grows in damp meadows and grassy glades. Oat roots like it where it's sunny and dry. They are sweet and juicy.</string>
<string id="1744" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hurriedly chew the thick and crunchy root. But your mouth feels like it is burning, likewise your throat. You spit out what you haven't swallowed, and furiously rub your tongue. Indeed, it's hard to tell at once whether the herb is good for humans to eat, or contains some ruddy poison! It's a good thing you haven't swallowed it all. Maybe it's not yet time to start making a grave boat.</string>
<string id="1745" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hastily chew and swallow the roots — they are fibrous and almost tasteless, but they are the only food to be had here. However, your throat is suddenly grasped by a spasm that leads to a horrendous hacking cough. You cannot stop it and it keeps shaking your body. The accursed root is stuck somewhere inside, tickling your throat. You barely manage to finish coughing and wipe the tears from your eyes.</string>
<string id="1746" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull in haste, trying to make the tangled roots leave the soil, but they're still stuck, as though some underground spirit was pulling them back from the other side. You feel angered and try to grab the root deeper, and then you suddenly feel your fingernail peel away from your finger. You passionately curse the Earth and its voracious maw as you examine your hand. There it is — the index finger is naked, with no nail on it. The remaining fingernails have their outlines traced in black. They are jagged and resemble the claws of a very dirty bird.</string>
<string id="1747" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of healers, who spend their lifetimes handling herbs and roots. From spring to autumn they gather their roots, leaves, and flowers, and during the winter they hang them up to dry. And they use them for treating the ailing folk.</string>
<string id="1748" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that it would be really nice if you came across a greater number of young roots. They may be thinner, but they sure are sweeter. Old ones are tasteless and tough as wood — you would need teeth of iron to chew them.</string>
<string id="1749" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You get a good grip on the stalk and give it a sharp yank, but leaves can be sharper than swords at times! Such a leaf can turn and give a sharp cut. You bring your palm closer and watch a crimson drop grow at the cut, and then form a trickle in the creases on your palm.</string>
<string id="1750" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You contemplate how plants grow in both directions as once. We see flowers and leaves, while the roots remain underground. Do the denizens of Netherworld also harvest them for food? Or do they walk or stalk their prey in a forest of roots?</string>
<string id="1751" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice that the soil always has a specific smell. It is moist with dew and underground juices, sweet and fragrant with herbs and roots, and as warm as if it were the breath of Mother Earth herself.</string>
<string id="1752" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall what your dear mother used to teach you: the sweet white root will give you strength. The hard and bitter one will cure ailments. And the soft yellow one will fill you up just like well-salted butter.</string>
<string id="1753" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your stomach rumbles, demanding something more substantial than measly roots. You are trying to placate it and imagine that those crunchy things in your mouth are the bones of a young lamb and not mere roots. Or the crunchy crust of a pig roasted on a spit.</string>
<string id="1754" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a stone of a fitting size on the ground — gods appear to favor you today! However, when you pick up the stone, you instantly throw it away — the useless thing isn't a flint. So it isn't divine benevolence, after all — more like a mocking grin.</string>
<string id="1755" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend to pick up the stone. It is partially covered in dry dirt, and you try to peel it off with your fingernails. But the stone is ill-pleased, and so it scratches you with a sharp edge. The white scratch that goes all across your finger breaks your skin in two and quickly fills up with blood.</string>
<string id="1756" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember that healers view flint as a useful stone, too — some use hot iron to cauterize wounds, but in your land they always used powdered flint. The wounds healed in no time at all!</string>
<string id="1757" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Flints are good for a lot more than making weapons or tools. If you find a smooth and pretty stone, conceal it and wear it somewhere on the left side of your person — closer to the heart, as it were. Such a stone will make your heart brave, and your head intelligent.</string>
<string id="1758" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a healer woman who recommended to always carry a flint with you — it is good for your stomach, and will protect you from poison.</string>
<string id="1759" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall how your mother always kept a few pieces of flint in the milk jug — an old method of keeping the milk fresh.</string>
<string id="1760" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up the stone from the ground and cannot help admiring it. There is a colored concentric circle pattern, and the stone appears to be opalescent. You think that under different circumstances it could be made into a figurine or a brooch, but you will have to let that beauty go unseen.</string>
<string id="1761" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall how the water in the well got a musty odor — back when you were still a child and lived in your parental home. The well was plated by flint from the inside, stone by stone, and that was that. The water became clear and it even seemed to have gotten a sweeter taste.</string>
<string id="1762" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a large and heavy lump of flint. Just what you need! Your spirits rise, and you even begin to whistle some simple tune.</string>
<string id="1763" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You search for a suitable stone and remember that the hardest rock you can find is a flint. If you can scratch it with some other stone, it isn't flint, and you have to keep looking.</string>
<string id="1764" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall the phrase "hard as flint." You think of how true it is. Some people just keep on going with great resolve, without giving an inch, no matter how hard fate tries them. Flint is like that — you can scratch it, you can hit it, but it won't yield. A resilient stone.</string>
<string id="1765" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that flint is more than a mere rock. After all, does every rock produce sparks, those little golden flies? It could be that its core is golden, and that you need to know just how to split it, so that the gold doesn't disappear.</string>
<string id="1766" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look under your feet, going over the stones scattered underneath with an attentive eye. Finding the stone you need among the others is no mean feat. Your eye roams in search of a shiny side, which resembles a piece of congealed fat, which has the same dull shine in the sun.</string>
<string id="1767" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall how you worked together with your father. When you chip off a thin layer of flint, it is smooth and brittle. If you bring it to your eye and stare at the sun, you can sometimes just about see the sunlight coming through. That's when your father would start yelling that you shouldn't be gawking at the son — he could throw something heavy at you, too.</string>
<string id="1768" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that the fastest way to find a piece of good flint is to go to the seashore. Water has great power. It can break rocks and even grind them into flour-like particles of dust. But not flint. It is the hardiest stone of them all.</string>
<string id="1769" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are trying to find a whole unbroken stone, without any cracks. A small burrow hole will affect the durability of the whole stone, making it worthless.</string>
<string id="1770" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look underneath your feet attentively, intent on finding a stone with smooth sides that seem polished. Such a stone brings good fortune, for it is nothing but a thunderous arrow shot from the Heavens by the Thunderer God.</string>
<string id="1771" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that a flint is just like clay in skilled hands — an experienced craftsman can easily shape a stone the way he wants. There must be some mystery to this — a secret word or some such.</string>
<string id="1772" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it very odd that there are lands where they have never found any flint. People from over there come to pay their respects to us bringing all kinds of old stuff and shale to trade.</string>
<string id="1773" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You were looking right underneath your feet, so it is a mystery just how you managed to overlook the root protruding from underground. You trip your foot on it and fall flat on your face. Your body is buzzing all over, the scratched skin feels raw, and there's a black and blue lump ripening on your head, which is as hard as flint itself.</string>
<string id="1774" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a yellowish triangle on the ground that looks like a piece of butter. You pick it up, admiring the craftsman's amazing work — skilfully cut sides, and a well-sharpened tip. A great arrowhead!</string>
<string id="1775" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You anticipate how you will quench your thirst with water. It will be cold, as though born of melting ice, making your teeth ache and numbing your throat.</string>
<string id="1776" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it might be a good idea to put a few flint stones into the waterskin, for it has been said by knowledgeable people that they have ability to purify.</string>
<string id="1777" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are amazed by how much the water resembles the sky — when the skies darken, the waters underneath are getting murky, too. When the skies are of transparent blue hues, the waters that be upon the Earth are also peacefully cerulean. When the lakes suffer from thirst, they draw in the waters from the Heavens. For Heaven appears to be made of water. Cool blue water.</string>
<string id="1778" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The weight of the water is dragging your arm down, and you try to get a better grip of the skin. But it is still wet — it slips out and hits the ground, making a gurgling sound. The skin's mouth opens, the water pours out and is absorbed by the earth in an instant. You kick the skin, but there's not much you can do, so you go back to fetch more water.</string>
<string id="1779" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a startled shoal of fish in the deep — they raise a murky muddy cloud at the bottom of the lake. You wait for the mud to settle down in order to get some clean water.</string>
<string id="1780" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a large fish splash and even see a dark shadow lurking underwater. It would be great to catch it, but you won't reach that deep.</string>
<string id="1781" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look into the waterskin and see a green blade of grass on the surface of the water. You stick your finger into the skin and deftly fish it out.</string>
<string id="1782" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a good drink of warmish water before you realize it has a foul taste. Stale water will cause a real hurricane in your stomach!</string>
<string id="1783" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rinse the waterskin before filling it with fresh water by pouring some water in, splashing it around, and pouring it back with a gurgling sound.</string>
<string id="1784" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Water rushes into the waterskin, displacing the air. The air rushes out in round bubbles, perturbing the water on the surface.</string>
<string id="1785" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You throw a rock into the water and marvel for the umpteenth time at how a simple rock can cause ripples on the water — vibrating circles of perfect shape that multiply, becoming wider, and then disappear.</string>
<string id="1786" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the kind of chill that usually dwells near the water. You can always feel motion here — the air is fresh and never still; the surface of the water is covered in ripples, dimples, and waves. The plants that grow here are always vigorous and amaze you by their lush greenness.</string>
<string id="1787" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look into the waterskin and see that the water is murky with little particles of dirt. You have to pour out the water and immerse the waterskin into deeper water, where there will be no leaves or gnats on the surface.</string>
<string id="1788" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how even water always tastes different. The sweetest comes from springs, passing all the layers of the Earth on its way up. It is as though the dwarf folk that live underground poured honey into it.</string>
<string id="1789" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You ask the Water God for permission to take some water. The water god is rich and powerful — it won't beggar him for sure. But he may be ired by lack of reverence.</string>
<string id="1790" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dip your waterskin into the water and watch the bubbles of air that come out. But you fail to notice the narrow dark shadow that rushes toward your arm to defend its home. A sudden pain makes you drop the waterskin. Water is the last thing on your mind now — the venom of a water snake is serious business.</string>
<string id="1791" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that a human being can live up to 30 moons without food, but hardly more than a few days without water. For all living things have vital juices running through them, and those need to be replenished constantly.</string>
<string id="1792" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You contemplate how ingenuously the gods have made the Earth — they splashed seawater in some places and poured fresh water in others. No matter how much the two kinds of water mix, the division remains.</string>
<string id="1793" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">As you fill your waterskin, you cup your hands, scoop up some water, and pour it over your face. You instantly feel a pleasant coolness rush over your face, washing the dust and the weariness away.</string>
<string id="1794" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend over the water and see your own face. It ripples, changing its expressions grotesquely, but no ripples hide the fact that your complexion resembles gray sand, and that you are haggard with fatigue and lack of sleep.</string>
<string id="1795" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carefully peel off the bark wondering if there are any of those fat white maggots underneath. They can save one from starvation occasionally — they say the taste resembles pine nuts a little.</string>
<string id="1796" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your head and it feels as though a green rain has poured over you — the wind makes a constant scattering noise, making the branches collide and the leaves rustle.</string>
<string id="1797" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The branch gives in to your efforts and breaks, hanging limply on a strip of bark. Your nose feels the bitter smell of a wounded tree.</string>
<string id="1798" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push the old branch aside in search of something fresher, but it rebounds, feeling slighted, and giving you a solid slap in the face. You are stunned for a few moments and feel your burning cheek in confusion.</string>
<string id="1799" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You grab onto a sturdy branch to pull yourself higher. But you feel a burning sensation in your palm and let go of the branches. There it is — a long gray track left under your skin by a splinter. Pulling it out won't be easy.</string>
<string id="1800" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your head and stop in your tracks — the play of green leaves in the wind is a fascinating sight. When they flutter, showing their silvery reverse side, they are just like silver coins that you imagine pouring down on you from the Heavens.</string>
<string id="1801" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a shrub with blood red berries growing at the base of the tree. Their transparent skin is bursting with red juice. You pick a few berries, pop them in your mouth and crush them with your tongue. A while later your stomach is gripped by pain — it is as if it were screaming out, claiming the juice of these berries to be similar to the poisoned milk from the black breast of a field spirit.</string>
<string id="1802" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push aside the branches and see an enormous caterpillar with a horn on its head staring right at you. You make a grimace and feel a chill: what if it's the spirit of the tree manifesting in this form, expressing his displeasure with you for disturbing his dwelling?</string>
<string id="1803" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the trees and it seems to you that the spirit of the forest is hiding right behind them — you have even managed to see gray hair ruffled by the wind and dark knobbly hands.</string>
<string id="1804" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pop a twig into your mouth and chew its narrow tip. Your mouth is filled by the bitter taste of tree bark.</string>
<string id="1805" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dream of the summers to come, when the saplings' roots will start growing, making them vigorous and green. It is a long and painstaking activity, but its fruits are truly sweet.</string>
<string id="1806" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to climb higher, and pull yourself up, with your feet thrust against the trunk. One of your feet slips treacherously, and you fall on your back. The blow seems to have made your spleen trade places with your stomach, while your head rattles and hums like an empty beer barrel kicked by large men ired by their thirst.</string>
<string id="1807" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You address a heartfelt prayer to the Gods of Fertility, asking them to be generous to you and to share enough of their green goodness with you.</string>
<string id="1808" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pray that the gods give you a good omen, and turn your face toward the sky. A white splash lands right in the middle of your forehead. A craw cackles maliciously above you, and you wonder whether the omen is good or whether the gods have mocked you by sending that vile bird.</string>
<string id="1809" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see winding tracks in the bark — you feel as though they were arranging themselves into words. You follow them with your finger, trying to read them. But you fail to understand the will of gods — whether for good or ill.</string>
<string id="1810" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place your palm on the rough bark, feeling its warmth with your skin, and you appear to sense the immobile tree living and breathing nevertheless.</string>
<string id="1811" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how the tree is the source of life and how it nurtures and supports it, and then provides you with the bed that will take you on your last sea voyage…</string>
<string id="1812" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You loosen your fingers in order to get a better grip on the branches, but there's a sudden complication — a narrow cleft in the bark won't let your fingers go. You pull and twist your hand until your fingers are released, red and swollen.</string>
<string id="1813" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You reach out your hand to take a branch, but it stings your fingers maliciously. A twig that looks like a long thorn has ripped your skin open rather nastily.</string>
<string id="1814" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch the bark and think of how rough and solid it is — a far cry from the soft human skin. You think to yourself, "It figures — a tree has no shelter from rain or frost."</string>
<string id="1815" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pry up the bark, and a large sheet peels off, which you receive gladly. A great piece!</string>
<string id="1816" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to hack off a sizable piece of the tree's skin, but it feels as though it were armored. You make too hard an effort and cut your finger, and now you have to spend some time to take care of the wound and stop the bleeding.</string>
<string id="1817" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see the grooves in the bark form a complex wavy pattern and try to take a closer look at them. You are surprised — you see clear knife marks. What was whoever had left them trying to write? Their name? Or a plea for help? Could it be a warning of some sort of danger?</string>
<string id="1818" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your mother used to collect bark from young branches. She was a skilled healer and used her brews and infusions to treat everyone's ailments, be it burns, joint aches, or sprained tendons.</string>
<string id="1819" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and think about the unbreakable link between the bitter smell of the bark, its brownish-gray color and dry crackly texture, and the roughness you feel when you touch it.</string>
<string id="1820" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are completely engrossed in your work and it takes you a while to realize just what it was that had just fallen on your head with so much noise. You jump aside, startled, and rub your hurting head. There is a large club-like branch on the ground. The tree spirit probably doesn't like your company.</string>
<string id="1821" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your industriousness is punished by the tree — it throws a small twig right into your eye. You leap aside and blink furiously. The bark is the least of your worries now — all you want is to get the twig out of your eye, which looks like a waterfall of tears.</string>
<string id="1822" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The bark peels off, and a cloud of dust appears in the space underneath. It reaches your nostrils, and you sneeze thunderously.</string>
<string id="1823" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that it's best to peel bark right after the rain, when it soaks up some water and peels from the body of the tree easily.</string>
<string id="1824" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You slap the tree trunk — you have a feeling that its bark will be perfect for making bowls and mugs.</string>
<string id="1825" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You peel off the bark thinking that the best kind of kindling you can get is the bark of a birch tree. Should even that fail to start a fire, you have a special trick: the pieces of birch bark need to form a triangular mound.</string>
<string id="1826" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you can fashion a mug out of the bark — simple, yet elegant in its own way: of a deep yellow hue, just like butter. Or the sun during the last third of the day.</string>
<string id="1827" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that bark requires special treatment, unless you intend to use it for kindling — you must oil it to keep it supple. Or soak it in water, at the very least.</string>
<string id="1828" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the rough patterns on the bark and remember how there'd be boxes and lidded baskets made of birch in every household back home. Those were wrought very finely — there were patterned belts along the top and the bottom.</string>
<string id="1829" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You study the piece of bark and think that the only thing you can make is a mug of the simplest sort. But your land sure had skilled craftsmen — they could even make containers you could use to boil water, no less! And just to think of the decorations — all those painted, cut-out, and filed-out ornaments.</string>
<string id="1830" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You muse that you have never seen any larches on the island. Those are best for all kinds of containers and utensils — the wood doesn't crack or split.</string>
<string id="1831" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that with some trees you can only use the bark for making containers. The birch bark, for instance, can be used for almost anything — you can use it to make a bowl, if that's what you need, or, say, a ladle!</string>
<string id="1832" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the bark and think the rumor you heard about the nomads that had roamed along the southern borders of the Empire until recently — apparently, they have this custom of covering all their bark vessels with thick layers of butter or cream. Fancy wasting food on that! You can do without it perfectly well.</string>
<string id="1833" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You focus your eyes on the roots — it seems as though you can see something unusual among them. You were right! With a cry of joy, you pocket your extileent find!</string>
<string id="1834" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">As you estimate the amount of work required, you pick a piece of sticky resin up with your fingernail and pop it into your mouth. It's more fun to work when your jaws have something to do.</string>
<string id="1835" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at a gray toad that has crawled out onto one of the roots. You pry it up with your foot and you toss it aside — its pimply skin looks revolting. You wonder whether there is any truth to the rumor that you can find a gemstone inside a toad's head.</string>
<string id="1836" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Sweat is pouring into your eyes. You stop to rub it off with your hand.</string>
<string id="1837" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You turn your palms upwards and cringe as you blow on them. They're all covered in blisters and cracks, and they won't let you get much work done.</string>
<string id="1838" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of tree roots reaching so far underground that no human can ever reach. Maybe the water they drink comes from the very source of wisdom.</string>
<string id="1839" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly see an old mark on the bark that has already healed. You wonder who could have marked their way here in such a manner. Someone from mainland, perhaps? Or the natives? A chill runs down your spine.</string>
<string id="1840" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pretend to be a mighty warrior battling with a giant monster. Your sword pierces the wooden flesh, chopping off tentacles. Severed limbs convulse, and the monster dies right at your feet.</string>
<string id="1841" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are concerned about the wind — it might be too strong. If the wind joins forces with the tree, they can play an evil trick on you by squashing you like a bug when you least expect it.</string>
<string id="1842" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the trunk to find out just where to start chopping. If the tree is bent or crooked, it's much easier.</string>
<string id="1843" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You don't mess around with trees — when something that big falls on someone, he'll be squashed like a grape!</string>
<string id="1844" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You mark the place of the first cut. Once the cut is made, you take it out just like a slice of a pie, and then you fell the tree in that direction.</string>
<string id="1845" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that it's hard to do this without a helper. You could obviously use some assistance in pulling the rope and pushing the trunk.</string>
<string id="1846" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cut the branches from the side the tree will fall onto — it will weigh less, and you will be safe from flying wood chips.</string>
<string id="1847" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It would, of course, be easier to climb the tree and then start felling it from the top. But there's a saying that you shouldn't cut the branch you're sitting on.</string>
<string id="1848" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to remember when it last rained. A moist tree is heavy, and its trunk is slippery. It will be much harder in that case.</string>
<string id="1849" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You put your hand on the rough bark and ask the spirits of the forest and the earth to forgive you for taking away one of their kin.</string>
<string id="1850" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Now isn't that a pretty stump! You could put some dinnerware on and sit down to eat right away. Just like a table, I swear!</string>
<string id="1851" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Uprooting stumps is hard — worse than any forced labor. First you need to dig a trench around it, and then you must cut off the roots. You'll know the true meaning of "weary" by the time it is over!</string>
<string id="1852" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have dug a trench around the stump, but it's still rooted solidly in the earth. You sit down on it to catch a breather. It would be more convenient to pry it up with a stick, and then to use it like a lever. It would probably fly up like a stone from a slingshot.</string>
<string id="1853" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down over the cutting and inhale the very essence of the forest with your nostrils. It smells of wood, moss, and fungal rot.</string>
<string id="1854" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You trace the rough texture of the cut with your finger, studying the sequence of rings — dark and light, wide and narrow, admiring the great age of the felled tree.</string>
<string id="1855" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the stump and it looks to you just like a giant octopulos with its tentacles deep underground, holding tightly onto a treasure chest and absolutely refusing to let go. No matter how deep you dig or how fiercely you chop.</string>
<string id="1856" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel reluctant to strain your back by uprooting the stump. You think that, perhaps, you should burn it.</string>
<string id="1857" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your lower back — the last thing you need is to rupture your back and spend weeks convalescing.</string>
<string id="1858" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What an enormous tree it was! Not even two people together could get their arms around the trunk!</string>
<string id="1859" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Come on already, open that tentacle grip of yours! See how hard it holds on! It must be sucking the blood of Mother Earth. But they won't do you much good now that your head's been cut off!</string>
<string id="1860" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The wood shavings fly merrily in every direction — it is as though small beetles disturbed by the saw were leaving their dwelling.</string>
<string id="1861" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Toward you and then away, toward you — and away. The monotony of these repetitive actions is making you melancholy. It looks like the ritual dance of those wild steppe tribes when they try to make it rain.</string>
<string id="1862" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the log from both sides. What if you approach from the other end? It seems as though it might be easier this way.</string>
<string id="1863" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull the saw toward yourself and rub your palm on the log. It feels as if it were licked by a dragon's rough tongue of stone. You take a good look at your hand and see that the skin is raw and bleeding.</string>
<string id="1864" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The saw makes a singing sound and jumps away from the log. You try to get it started once again, but it bends and jumps away once more. You quickly mumble a prayer to guard yourself against the trickery of evil spirits and get back to work.</string>
<string id="1865" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden sting. You bring your hand closer to your eyes to take a closer look and see a splinter in your palm. Although this is no mere splinter — it looks more like a large chip of wood driven about half an inch deep into your palm.</string>
<string id="1866" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The saw mark on the log reminds you of a grin. You tell the tree that it is free to mock all it wants. We'll see who gets to laugh in the end!</string>
<string id="1867" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A single awkward movement makes you stop. You kick the log angrily — its hard fibers have bent the saw, and you will now have to waste your precious time on fixing it.</string>
<string id="1868" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the log thinking of how dry wood is harder than wet wood. However, even though it is easier to saw a wet log, the wet sawdust clings to the saw and steals away its power and speed.</string>
<string id="1869" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The harsh and vibrating sound made by the saw cuts through the silence, rings in your ears, and scares away the birds that sat nearby.</string>
<string id="1870" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You've had bad luck with the log. It is hard and crooked, and the saw sinks in it as though the wood were a swamp.</string>
<string id="1871" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You realize you had approached this task wrong from the very start, and now the handle of the saw has rubbed your hand raw. You look for something to use as a bandage lest you leave all your skin on the handle.</string>
<string id="1872" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall old men mentioning a special tree whose roots go all the way down to a holy sanctum deep underground. The tree was supposed to bear fruit that would give anyone who ate it the knowledge of many hidden things. You cut your daydream short by reminding yourself that you cannot fell that tree with a simple axe or an ordinary saw…</string>
<string id="1873" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place your palm on the rough surface of the tree and remember that all trees drink juices from underground, which means god himself imbues them with strength. You whisper your thanks to the god for his permission to take one of his trees.</string>
<string id="1874" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember what your father would say about labor of any sort: "Eyes may fear, but the hands will still steer." He was right, of course — all things are difficult before they are easy.</string>
<string id="1875" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your father, who would always say: "A man's strength is in his work." You shouldn't idle about while there's still work to be done.</string>
<string id="1876" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You like the smell of resin that comes from the tree. You pry a piece of opaque resin from the bark and pop it into your mouth. It has a pleasant woody taste with strong pine-needle notes.</string>
<string id="1877" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dig a shallow pit for the little tree — this way, the roots will find air quicker. You cannot help comparing the pit to a cozy little house.</string>
<string id="1878" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have planted the sapling, and are now tilling the soil around it — it will be more comfortable and easier for the young roots to breathe this way.</string>
<string id="1879" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a look at your little tree and remove the broken branches, weak and helpless. They will not revive, at any rate, but they will take away some of the plant's vital juices.</string>
<string id="1880" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of manure and how nice it would be to mix some with the soil to keep the roots warm and well-nourished.</string>
<string id="1881" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You choose a small hillock to plant your sapling. Your grandfather already knew this, and he passed the knowledge on to you: the soil on such mounds is more nutritious; there's also more air, and a smaller chance that excess moisture will cause root rot.</string>
<string id="1882" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the little tree — it knows where it wants to grow. The darker side has to face the south, and the lighter side will face the darker side of the sky.</string>
<string id="1883" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You plant the sapling and stomp around to make sure the ground is compact. Now you can take a breather.</string>
<string id="1884" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You utter a short prayer for the God of the Netherworld, who watches over everything that happens underground, would make the roots grow better and give vigor to the trunk.</string>
<string id="1885" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine your tree and gently remove the leaves, taking care not to damage the burgeons. The sapling doesn't need them yet, and all they do is squander water.</string>
<string id="1886" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You plant the sapling and are now looking at your hand — there is a piece of bark deep under one of your fingernails. The finger hurts and you're trying to pry the splinter loose, but to no avail. You think that if you stick about a hundred such splinters under someone's fingernails, that will amount to proper torture.</string>
<string id="1887" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have tried to choose sturdy trees for planting. After all, a rotten root bears no sweet fruit.</string>
<string id="1888" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Before you plant the sapling, you carefully slice a piece of one of its side roots. You look at the clear white cut with pleasure — the root is alive and healthy. A dry root would have been brown.</string>
<string id="1889" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch the little trunk with your hand and think that trees have real healing power. Healers know which trees cure ailments, which fill one's body with strength, and which make sure the head thinks pleasant thoughts.</string>
<string id="1890" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">They say there's a tree that is a thousand times stronger than these — wider and taller. But has anyone seen it? It is said to be guarded by wild beasts who tear apart anyone who dares to approach. But if there are no living witnesses, who can testify to the tree's existence?</string>
<string id="1891" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You make a vow: if the tree lives, you will bury its first fruit in the ground to express your gratitude to God.</string>
<string id="1892" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You want to cover the roots with soil, but suddenly notice something in the pit. You reach for it and pick up a strange object.</string>
<string id="1893" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall your father's special method of planting trees. He would plant them in such a way that they would protect the house from the wind, as well as summer heat.</string>
<string id="1894" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You run your hand over the grass and cringe — a sharp blade of grass that looks like a double-edge sword has cut your palm.</string>
<string id="1895" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something that doesn't look like either a rock or a pile of leaves in the grass. You bend down and pick up a very interesting item.</string>
<string id="1896" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You make a heavy step and notice that you've stepped on a serpent's tail when it's already too late. The reptile is long enough to bend over backwards and drive a venomous tooth into your leg. You crush the snake's head with your other foot, but what you need to do first and foremost is remove the poison from your body.</string>
<string id="1897" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up a pale pink flower and crush the petals in your fingers. A pleasant tangy smell reaches your nostril. You think it would be nice to gather some of them and use them to brew a bracing beverage that's very good for you.</string>
<string id="1898" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see fragrant white flowers in the grass. You aren't tempted by the smell — you know that if you spend a few minutes near them, you'll get a headache.</string>
<string id="1899" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a deep breath. You breathe in a special kind of air that smells of wet earth and fresh grass, with a slight aroma of flowers.</string>
<string id="1900" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch the serrated leaves and remember that this plant's flowers can only be seen once a year, so who has ever seen them? This flower can float in the air and lead you to buried treasure. That's why it doesn't reveal itself to just anyone.</string>
<string id="1901" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down to see whether the mushroom is maggoty. You recall the words of your mother about every mushroom being edible. All you need to know is how to cook it right.</string>
<string id="1902" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the leaves apart and your hand touches a bush that's all covered in thorns. One of the thorns pricks your finger, and you suck out a droplet of blood — you never know whether or not the bush might be poisonous.</string>
<string id="1903" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look deep into the grass, trying to find yellow berries. They are watery and rather bland, but they remind you of home.</string>
<string id="1904" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You saw an unusual plant. Its jagged leaves resemble flames of fire. Or the ornaments on the attire of the northerners.</string>
<string id="1905" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a strange plant — its leaves are rolled into narrow tubes, and the flowers have shiny white petals. You break off the stalk — maybe you'll get a chance to show it to someone who knows what this plant is and what properties it has.</string>
<string id="1906" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up a branch and start waving it around as though it were a sword. You strike left and right, scattering the flowers, which fall on the ground. You shake your "sword" victoriously, and then you shake your head — such juvenile behavior.</string>
<string id="1907" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">An unpleasant smell reaches your nostrils, and your experienced eye notices off-white bell-like flowers amidst the grass. You recognize these flowers — their juice makes cow milk taste revolting. Should a cow be stupid enough to eat a lot of them, it will behave like mad, and may even gore its owner with its horns.</string>
<string id="1908" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see the plant you need, but you refrain from picking it. Its leaves are rolled into tubes, with white cobwebs all over. The caterpillars have managed to beat you to it, and now the plant is only edible to the insect folk.</string>
<string id="1909" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are amazed by the sheer variety of grasses. There are hundreds of hues and smells, and they are making your head spin. You stop. Then you realize that your head is spinning because of the vapors of jimsonweed, and that you need some fresh air to chase them away.</string>
<string id="1910" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the grass apart and jerk your hand back — it feels as if you touched a flame. You see how the poisonous sap is making your hand burn, redden, and get covered in small blisters.</string>
<string id="1911" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The hundreds and hundreds of grasses underneath your feat exude an unbelievable smell. You tear off the head of a flower and chew it slowly, feeling the taste of honey on your tongue.</string>
<string id="1912" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick the herb you need, only to notice the plant is dry, with withered leaves and a brittle stalk. You crush it in your hands and scatter the fragments to the wind.</string>
<string id="1913" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">An unassuming bug jumps onto your hand. You thoughtlessly flick it away, and the strong odor informs you that you have just chased away a shield bug. Its acrid stench will now accompany you halfway to your destination at least.</string>
<string id="1914" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down to break away a stalk at the very base, but a tiny striped warrior attacks you. You recognize it as a wasp, and angrily rub the sting. Your hand itches and swells up in an ugly red patch.</string>
<string id="1915" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You watch out for the stalks and leaves, but you also keep in mind the roots, which you dig out. You hope to find the Root of Life — it grows from the very depths of the Earth, and the Great God himself is said to give it power.</string>
<string id="1916" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to wave away a pesky fly that keeps getting into your face, and accidentally touch the grass, whose sharp tongues grow tall, facing the sky. The long green blade slices your finger open like any knife.</string>
<string id="1917" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick a leaf of grass and pop the narrow edge into your mouth. You crush the narrow stalk with your teeth, sucking out the sweet sap.</string>
<string id="1918" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a handful of red berries right next to the ground. They may not be very juicy, but they're very sweet. This is typical for open places in the sun, as you note.</string>
<string id="1919" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the green grass apart and see a large beetle with an ugly horn on its snout. You think that the monster is watching you, and has even lowered its head menacingly. You spit angrily and let the grass spring back to cover up the beetle. You are not afraid — far from it — but what if it's an evil spirit guarding its territory.</string>
<string id="1920" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look under your feet, and your heart fills with joy — you have found a rare ingredient!</string>
<string id="1921" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your hand reaches for the ripe grapes as though it were moving of its own accord. You swallow one grape after another, but, before you even finish the last one, you feel your face and hands begin to itch. You suddenly feel a chill inside — someone must have cursed you!</string>
<string id="1922" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop to take a deep breath. The smell of the herbs and the flowers makes you dizzy and fills your soul with joy at the same time. You could praise all the gods right now.</string>
<string id="1923" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that someday you will find your recipe for immortality. You have thought out the recipe of the potion in great detail, but there is still something missing — doubtlessly, some small and very rare herb…</string>
<string id="1924" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you are really close to your own recipe for transforming rocks into gold. You were almost lucky once, and the rock even took on a yellow hue, but the magic vanished in the light of day. However, you're not a quitter and hope to fill your purse with gold ingots of your own someday.</string>
<string id="1925" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sort through the herbs and notice that your hands are green and emit a pleasant herbal smell.</string>
<string id="1926" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think irritatedly that your fingers have grown completely rough from all the work, and it's really hard for you to pick thin stalks and the heads of small flowers.</string>
<string id="1927" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall having invented the potion of youth a long time ago, when you were still a lad — you even managed to test it on your old nanny. She complained the drink did her no good, and even had to spend the whole night sitting in the bushes. But you saw how her face, which had looked like a baked turnip, became really smooth by the morning. She claims the accursed drink made her face swell up, but you know the truth.</string>
<string id="1928" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the stalks, but they're not supple enough and rather dry — they won't be useful to you.</string>
<string id="1929" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your face to the trees — sometimes they are all covered in sturdy green ropes. These parasitic vines are just what you need — as good as any rope.</string>
<string id="1930" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to estimate whether the stalks you have found are strong enough by stretching them hard. You nod approvingly — these should do.</string>
<string id="1931" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how one of your uncles, who wasn't particularly fond of work, made one of his tools out of an old root. So what happened next? Obviously enough, they wore out quickly, and the stone fell out. The uncle lost his axe as well as one of his toes.</string>
<string id="1932" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You casually pick a red berry from a bush and toss it in your mouth. Sweeter than honey!</string>
<string id="1933" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are going through the types of knots you know in your mind, thinking of which of them would be best to use on the threads. The woman's knot isn't called this for nothing — it is only fit for tying head-scarves. A weaver's knot or a cow's knot will hold much better.</string>
<string id="1934" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a suitable stalk and grab it deftly. But it proves harder than you thought — it holds fast, and you need some effort. The tough old stalk breaks with a loud crack, and you fly like a missile from the catapult, landing on your back and raising a cloud of dust from the grass. You get up groaning and rubbing your aching back.</string>
<string id="1935" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that hemp fiber is the best material for a rope. Hair is good, too, likewise woven tendons.</string>
<string id="1936" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you have finally found a fitting material, but notice a spider's web nearby. You pick up the cobweb and use it to wipe your hands — it has been known since times immemorial that a spider's thread makes one's hands strong and agile.</string>
<string id="1937" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down and notice that the grass and the rocks aren't the only things you see under your feet. You think you have found something quite extraordinary.</string>
<string id="1938" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your long stride is broken by a root protruding from the ground. You flutter your hands as if you were trying to get airborne, but the miracle does not happen. You fall down like a heavy sack. Now you know what it really means to knock the breath out of someone.</string>
<string id="1939" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">One of your earliest childhood memories is of ships entering the harbor, well-cured by the wind and the sea. Swarthy tanned sailors hoist down all sorts of goods — sometimes the children gawking from underneath get their hands on something, too. An overripe exotic fruit, a darkened piece of wood, or an extremely strong piece of rope from the rigging.</string>
<string id="1940" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull on the threads, but they're taut as hard as a bowstring and cut your palm with ease. You clench your fist and see a trickle of blood come out.</string>
<string id="1941" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect how they used to weave rope in the days of your — the plants were dried, soaked, and then broken and scutched by the women. Then they would heckle and card it, and only after than they could start weaving a rope.</string>
<string id="1942" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think some nettle would come in handy — you can use it to make strong and durable rope. All you need to do is find tall plants. Then you have to remove the leaves and make a cut lengthwise — not too deep, but not too shallow, either.</string>
<string id="1943" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that if you fail to find a suitable material, bark will do, too. If you slice it up in long thin strips, it is also usable.</string>
<string id="1944" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your mother's agile fingers would expertly crush dried threads, spin them, twist them, and pull them between the thumb and the back of a knife. It's common knowledge — the cleaner the threads, the stronger the rope.</string>
<string id="1945" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you could make a fitting rope if you came across some hemp. All you need to do is to choose a female plant. Male plants are more suitable for making fabric.</string>
<string id="1946" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to choose a vigorous plant with a thick stalk — it will probably bear replanting easier.</string>
<string id="1947" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You say the magic words to make the spirits of the forest take heed of you. You cannot so much as pick a flower or crush a blade of grass without their leave.</string>
<string id="1948" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You keep searching, but you fail to notice a tree's sharp claw reaching for you. Your face gets covered in scratches in an instant. Yet you are happy that you have managed to protect your eyes.</string>
<string id="1949" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Wow! What could this be? You bend down and pick up something one doesn't usually find in the forest.</string>
<string id="1950" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that with gardening you never can tell what the result will be. Maybe you just shouldn't bother… Then you recall your mother's succulent apple pies, or her rhubarb pie… Ah well, pies are worth the effort.</string>
<string id="1951" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are thinking of the Goddess of Fertility, whom you have to placate — nothing grows without her leave, not even the nettles by the side of the road.</string>
<string id="1952" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your neck. Staring into the ground all the time is strenuous — even a neck of steel would break eventually.</string>
<string id="1953" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a beetle lying helpless on its back. "What a clumsy creature!" you think as you poke the beetle with a stick. Once the beetle gets hopeful and grabs onto it with its feet, you flick it down to the ground. The beetle is on the ground again, trying hard to open its wings. You laugh out loud — that was a funny joke.</string>
<string id="1954" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a deafening crackle and stop in your tracks. Cold sweat runs down your back. What could it be?! A bear… or a boar? Or the spirits of the forest coming to get you? One of the natives with a poisoned spear hiding in the bushes? All is silent… You realize the crack came from the twig you have stepped on.</string>
<string id="1955" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a fitting plant and pull it by the stalk instead of digging it out. That wasn't a good idea! The rough stalk scrapes the palms of your hands raw.</string>
<string id="1956" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice some horsetail. It's an extremely verminous plant — you cannot drive it out or pull it out. But it may not be as useless as people think… They say horsetails guard gold.</string>
<string id="1957" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are thinking of digging up some of those bushes with pumpkin-colored flowers — an infusion of those makes wounds heal much faster. And the small magenta ones are good against cough.</string>
<string id="1958" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that all the plants get their juices from the Earth. And Mother Earth must be getting her power from the Dreamer who sleeps within her.</string>
<string id="1959" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Once I finish planting, I'll read a prayer in every corner and bury some charmed plants her to make sure those voracious beetles leave the green leaves well alone.</string>
<string id="1960" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are concerned about moles — those pests can dig up the plants' roots, suffocating them.</string>
<string id="1961" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how back home you had to call the priests, and they would determine whether or not you could plant anything. They should know better — after all, they ask permission from the gods for everything.</string>
<string id="1962" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have failed to notice old yellow nettles. They sting your hand, even though they have already withered. The older a nettle, the sharper its teeth.</string>
<string id="1963" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a plant with unfamiliar jagged leaves and large red berries. This plant doesn't resemble any of those known to you. You break off a branch to dry it and show it to a knowledgeable person whenever you get the chance.</string>
<string id="1964" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see some crimson berries hiding among the leaves. You hastily toss them into your mouth — their juice quenches thirst perfectly.</string>
<string id="1965" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel something sting your ankle painfully. As you thought — you didn't give the reptile the right-of-way, and it retaliated immediately.</string>
<string id="1966" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the tree branches apart in search of cocoons and think of the amazing talent of the caterpillars — to create sliding threads that are nearly weightless.</string>
<string id="1967" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the branches in hopes of finding a cocoon, thinking the fabric that glistens in the sun does not necessarily have to be worn by kings. These days every peasant can dress in glorious silk — all you need to know is how to unravel the caterpillars' cocoons.</string>
<string id="1968" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cannot yet claim a good yield of silkworm cocoons, but you already imagine how you will dunk them in boiling water and then start unraveling the softened cocoons. Thin, near-invisible threads will stay on your fingers.</string>
<string id="1969" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the branches and wonder who may have thought of taking threads from caterpillars first. Darned if you know! The old emperor is said to have bought the secret for a few chests of gold! Or, perhaps, the nomads from the south were the first to have thought of it.</string>
<string id="1970" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a look at the tree, thinking that butterflies born in palaces of silk are rather unsightly — grayish wings, rather dull, looking like a large moth.</string>
<string id="1971" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that the butterfly that you noticed in front of you was a mulberry silkmoth. You are trying to see where it is headed in case you see some cocoons. You would like to catch it and find out whether it's true that butterfly mouths are sealed and they never eat during their winged life.</string>
<string id="1972" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Even though you did notice a butterfly, you keep on looking for cocoons. You know that silkmoths can breed several times during a summer, so the same tree can have butterflies, caterpillars, and cocoons on it.</string>
<string id="1973" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember seeing trees with all leaves devoured by silkworms. Those caterpillars are extremely voracious, and eat leaves the way fire eats wood.</string>
<string id="1974" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a tight white cocoon and are examining it. You are amazed with the diligence of these little weavers — it can take them four days to build a house of threads, tirelessly shaking their head from side to side.</string>
<string id="1975" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that even in case of silkworms males work harder than females. Males make tidy and thick cocoons, whereas females tend to slack off.</string>
<string id="1976" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find some cocoons and place them on your palm. They are white, with a rough feel, and very light — they look like the eggs of some forest bird.</string>
<string id="1977" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You haven't found any cocoons here, but there are lots of berries on the tree, large and fragrant. Their sweet juice fills your mouth.</string>
<string id="1978" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something white on the tree and you remove it from the leaf. You see a cocoon of a regular caterpillar — utterly worthless. You crush the cocoon in your hand and a greenish liquid comes out.</string>
<string id="1979" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to push the branch away, and it scratches your face with its claws. You rub your cheek with your hand — there must certainly be a red mark there.</string>
<string id="1980" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that silkworms have a fine taste, what with them feeding on mulberry leaves. The berries that grow on these trees are also fine — you can use them to make a tincture that will chase every ailment right out of your body at once!</string>
<string id="1981" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You scratch the back of your head wondering whether you really need those cocoons that badly. You'll have to gather a mind-boggling number of chrysalises to get a cut of cloth!</string>
<string id="1982" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your father's lessons — he showed you little young growth on the mulberry and said that if you see such shoots, the year will definitely be a warm one.</string>
<string id="1983" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick a chrysalis from a branch, thinking that you must by no means let the butterfly hatch. Its noxious saliva will burn a hole in the cocoon, rendering it worthless.</string>
<string id="1984" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly find yourself musing on what kind of threads the gods use for measuring out our fates. Or could it be to each their own — flaxen threads for the peasants, wool for the warriors, and silk for the king?</string>
<string id="1985" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stare in confusion and then recollect that whenever you see an open wound, you have to cauterize it with red-hot iron. Otherwise the body around it will blacken and deaden. And then the blackness will spread to the rest of the body.</string>
<string id="1986" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Oh dear! At any rate, you need to use a liquid that kills all illnesses. You should wipe it with urine. Drinking a urine tincture wouldn't hurt, either, but there's no one to make it here…</string>
<string id="1987" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hurry to help, but you don't know where to begin. Healers have something that works against pain! What could it be? Belladonna or opium usually, but there's nowhere to procure either right now!</string>
<string id="1988" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The only thing you remember is how to treat a wound left by a poisoned arrow or javelin. You cauterize it with iron, and then seal the wound with wax. That's the surest cure.</string>
<string id="1989" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A talisman would come in handy just now — an iron rectangle with symbols written upon it. You remember how this amulet saved your life with something other than magic once — it shattered the arrowhead that would have ended up piercing your chest otherwise!</string>
<string id="1990" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Dear old mother was so good at bandaging people! I wish I could remember what she taught me!</string>
<string id="1991" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the body in front of you perplexedly. Where do you begin? A spell against wounds? Or tying a damaged limb to a stick? Or should you use red-hot iron?</string>
<string id="1992" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect what few things you know about healing: the first thing to do with a wound is to suck out the blood. If a bone is broken, you should tie it to a stick. If the soul has left the body, you should burn some hair or a bone near the nose.</string>
<string id="1993" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">That's nothing! Some were chopped in half in such a way that the head would still blink its eyes while the feet had already run their last. The guy had no idea there was just half of him left, and you kept mum, too.</string>
<string id="1994" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think you've seen worse things in your life! Just to recall the wholesale slaughter of the first battles for the Empire's eastern borders. The ground ran red with blood, and the crows flew over the wounded like a black cloud, but even their cawing was drowned out by the yells and the groans… It is as though the rocks had opened up, and everyone was given a glimpse of hell.</string>
<string id="1995" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">All right, you take care! You'll live until you die — that thing should heal in no time!</string>
<string id="1996" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The Eastern reaches, now — that was something else! They attacked and, by golly, they crushed our army! I still remember how they galloped on, with their horses ramming through our ranks, and how their hooves crushed skulls like eggshells.</string>
<string id="1997" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Our sawbones was really something! He'd give you a stick to chew on and start twisting your limbs into shape. And is the arm or a leg was beyond healing, he'd just chop it off with an axe, and that was that. Some would grind their teeth into powder with that stick — not everyone can pull through something like that.</string>
<string id="1998" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It is unpleasant, of course, but nothing that couldn't be fixed. You should have seen this guy who had half his head smashed with a stone from a slingshot — you could even see his mashed brains. He didn't seem to mind too much — he even smiled.</string>
<string id="1999" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A nice drink to warm you up, that's what we need — the spirits will instantly spread through your blood, making your body hale and your spirit merry!</string>
<string id="2000" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You must have felt icy paws scratching deep inside? That's fine — we'll burn them with fire, and let them search for another soul!</string>
<string id="2001" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">This is nothing compared to what I've seen with my own eyes! Some would have their stomachs slashed open, with their guts falling into the dust. Others had their heads chopped off — the head flies some 20 feet away, and the body drops down right there next to you. There's nothing you can do but press on and try to avoid blinking.</string>
<string id="2002" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">If you let every wind drop you down like that, you won't get anywhere. Pull yourself together — we'll have mead at their funeral yet!</string>
<string id="2003" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch out your feet, thinking it would be really nice to stretch them towards a bright fire… The warmth would spread through your body, and there would be steam coming from your wet clothes…</string>
<string id="2004" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sit down and stretch with great relish, and then scratch with gusto. Isn't it nice to relax sometimes!</string>
<string id="2005" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch so hard your joints crackle, and give a wide yawn. The weary muscles are filling with languor.</string>
<string id="2006" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch out your feet and wiggle your toes. You think that a comfortable pair of shoes would come in handy — you could make them, perhaps, or maybe someone will trade you a pair. You dream of strong brown leather softly gripping your foot, with snug-fitting straps on top.</string>
<string id="2007" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Some lunch sure wouldn't be amiss now! Smoky pork and sweet-smelling bread hot from the oven, washed down by a good swig of beer… Food of the gods. You wallow in your daydream with your eyes shut tight in anticipation.</string>
<string id="2008" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Isn't it nice to sit down like that? you think to yourself. "I don't really feel like I'm myself when I haven't had any rest."</string>
<string id="2009" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The moment you sit down like that, all sorts of things occur to you. Do gods observe you every moment, and if they do, where were they looking when you cut your finger with a knife a few days ago? And is it true there are rivers underground just like ours, and also cities? And does the Sacred Tree really support all nine worlds upon itself?</string>
<string id="2010" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sit down and press your palms against the ground — you hope the God of the Netherworld will share some of his power with you this way.</string>
<string id="2011" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You shut your eyes for a moment, thinking to yourself that you shouldn't fall asleep. But the sleep glues your eyelids together better than any wax, and you begin to doze off.</string>
<string id="2012" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your shoulders thinking you could do with some better clothes.</string>
<string id="2013" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how pleasant it is to spend time with others from time to time — to sit by the fire, telling tall tales, and recalling things that happened in your glorious past.</string>
<string id="2014" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see an ant on the ground, hurrying about its own business. You wonder how such a small ant can have enough strength to carry a straw that is ten times heavier. Does it rely on higher powers? You gingerly lift the straw with your thumb and forefinger to lighten the insect's burden. But the ant drops the straw — apparently, it is accustomed to take care of everything by itself or with the aid of its kin.</string>
<string id="2015" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up a wood chip with your fingers and start doodling on the ground. You look at the doodles as though they were symbols that you can decipher.</string>
<string id="2016" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at your hands and see wiry veins covering the backs of your hands like rivers of blue. Hard work spares no one — your skin gets rough, your arms get veined, and you get black grime underneath your fingernails.</string>
<string id="2017" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember what your father used to say: "Find time for work, but be sure to leave an hour for leisure." The wise old man knew life well.</string>
<string id="2018" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your heart seems to be skipping beats in your chest like a small fluttering bird flinging itself against your ribs as though they were the bars of a cage. You really have to take a break — you've been working non-stop and are now feeling like a horse that's been ridden down.</string>
<string id="2019" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You like to just sit there and daydream without being disturbed. You can dream of so many things — for instance, you can dream you are someone else; someone with lands and cattle, for example. All you have to do is wave a hand if you want a chalice of mead — or someone to scratch your heels. You wave your hand in a commanding manner, forgetting there is no one there to rush to your beckon.</string>
<string id="2020" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take the chance offered by your momentary respite and fish a pebble that you found in the evening out of the folds of your clothes. It is a worthless pebble by any account — fit to be a child's toy and little else; and yet it is too beautiful and too smooth, and cannot help wanting to roll it in your fingers. You admire the intricate pattern of stripes on its sides, as smooth as if they were polished.</string>
<string id="2021" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your eyelids hard with your fingers — your eyes must be tired, or the wind may have blown some sand into them. Your eyelids remain shut, but you still see the wobbly black and orange circles left by finger pressure.</string>
<string id="2022" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the ground in order to check for fresh tracks — perhaps some light paws have left their prints somewhere.</string>
<string id="2023" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that it would be easier to set a second trap for small prey than to go hunting. A trap can save a lot of effort!</string>
<string id="2024" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You set your trap and think that catching an animal requires a lot of patience. The beast has to get used to the place, smell everything, and eventually decide everything is safe…</string>
<string id="2025" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You mark the place where you set the trap and think you should check it more often. Sometimes you fail to check the trap in due time, and the hare or the quail has already escaped! Either that, or it got eaten by a larger beast.</string>
<string id="2026" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how important it is to find a good place for your trap. A narrow path with overhanging branches is perfect — the beast will tear through the shrubs and will definitely get into the trap.</string>
<string id="2027" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Startling a hare is another good method. It will run into any trap in its terror, no matter how roughly you may make it.</string>
<string id="2028" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect a lesson taught by a hunter acquaintance — you may never change anything you see. You cannot break any twigs or walk over any tracks. If it's a hazel grove, you cannot make your trap out of pine or birch wood.</string>
<string id="2029" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the trap you've just set and cover it with leaves and dirt. This should make the whole thing more reliable.</string>
<string id="2030" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that you might want to use some smoke from a fire to make sure no trace of human smell remains anywhere.</string>
<string id="2031" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You check whether the trap you've set is sturdy enough. Any minute defect can be used by the animal to its advantage. It will break the trap and run away, much to your chagrin.</string>
<string id="2032" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have found a tall and supple tree for your trap — this way the beast or the bird will be hoisted right up, and no forest predator will be able to reach it.</string>
<string id="2033" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A fat quail would be just right. If you bake it in an open fire, you'll eat it up in no time, crunching the bones away! A hare is fine, too, provided it isn't too stringy. A hungry belly will rejoice at anything!</string>
<string id="2034" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You set your trap muttering a hasty prayer — may the gods hear it and grant you a good haul.</string>
<string id="2035" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wonder whether there may not be enough bait. However, forest beasts have a keen sense of smell. They can smell anything from a long way off, even crumbs.</string>
<string id="2036" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pole that you intended to use for the bait unbends suddenly and slaps you right in the face. The left side of your face feels totally numb.</string>
<string id="2037" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You anticipate how a fat hare will get caught in your trap and it occurs to you that you should test its strength. What if the hare proves too heavy and manages to run away? You should also use a thicker pole.</string>
<string id="2038" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You set your trap right on a path that has fresh animal tracks. You know that during the summer such tracks are usually moist — there can even be water inside them. During the winter they crumble at the lightest touch.</string>
<string id="2039" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend, and then straighten up again, trying to estimate whether the beast will see your contraption. As you keep on doing those exercises, you scratch your face as you stick it right into a bush, and, after an irate oath, you decide that the trap is probably not visible to animals.</string>
<string id="2040" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You test the pole's flexibility by bending and unbending it. Willow branches are best — there is so much moisture in them that you could probably tie a knot in the branch.</string>
<string id="2041" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the tracks — the ones at the top are wide, and the ones at the bottom are next to each other. These were obviously left by a hare. However, the tracks are rather old.</string>
<string id="2042" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down to take a closer look at the complex pattern of prints left by birds. They are fine and intricate, just like red embroidered patterns on women's dresses.</string>
<string id="2043" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to leave your own footprint on the path out of sheer curiosity. But it turns out very vague and hardly visible at all — the ground here is dense and compact.</string>
<string id="2044" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Hares are cunning beasts! They will never just run away from a hunter — they will leave a veritable labyrinth of tracks. Then you have to make a real effort to track them and to find out where they are hiding.</string>
<string id="2045" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that hunting is all about showing more cunning than the other party. A hare is clever — it winds and doubles its tracks. But the hunter is no fool, either. You need a particular kind of cunning — don't stop as you read the tracks, or the bunny will think that it's found and run as fast as it can. What you need to do is deceive the beast — just lift your feet and put them down again, but don't go anywhere. It will never be the wiser.</string>
<string id="2046" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You slip on a rotten piece of wood and flail your arms around as though you were trying to get airborne. You grab branches with your fingers and arch your back. You have managed to keep your balance, after all, but your fingers are all scratched by the branches.</string>
<string id="2047" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sharp pain makes you stop in your tracks. You lift your left leg and rub it with your hands. Your foot has failed to avoid a sharp stone, which injures the sole badly. How are you supposed to keep walking now?</string>
<string id="2048" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a hunter who was following a track in just as foolhardy a manner, claiming the most dangerous thing one might encounter there were a quail. He ended up disappearing in the woods without a trace! Only the forest spirits know what fate befell him.</string>
<string id="2049" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The strange sounds makes you shiver. Is that an owl hooting? Or an invisible forest spirit flying on wings of the night? You no longer care about tracks, studying the sky anxiously.</string>
<string id="2050" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You startled a magpie, and it has started to chatter loudly. You throw a ball of earth into the bird — if it carries on like this, it will scare all the animals away!</string>
<string id="2051" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A twig snaps under your foot, breaking the silence. You kick the piece of wood in frustration — it has announced your presence to all the animals around.</string>
<string id="2052" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the ground and notice an unusual lump that shines in the soft light. You pick it up — one doesn't find useful items like that every day.</string>
<string id="2053" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A lizard darts off from underneath your feet. You stomp your foot to catch its tail. But you are too clumsy, and the lizard is too agile. It hides in the rocks, and you realize that you have stomped all over the tracks.</string>
<string id="2054" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel something fall under the neck of your garment. A beetle! You feel it flounce and kick in every direction, trying to escape. The way you jump around to shake it out of your clothes resembles an elaborate dance.</string>
<string id="2055" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take an awkward step and twist your foot. You land on your rear end in surprise, rubbing your sprained ankle. If you carry on like this, you can end up lame!</string>
<string id="2056" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a heavy pine cone on the path. Its scales are stuck together by resin, which makes your fingers sticky, but the nuts you find inside are soft and sweet, with a milky taste.</string>
<string id="2057" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your foot sinks underground, and you barely manage to avoid breaking it. It may be someone's burrow or just a hole in the ground — or, maybe, it was dug by the mischievous spirits of the forest for fun. You shake your fist in the air, menacing no one in particular and everyone in general.</string>
<string id="2058" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the ground — the tracks appear to belong to a bear, the master of the forest. It will learn of your invasion instantly, and then it will keep its eye on you. If you think you're hunting it, you're deluded. He's got you in his sights.</string>
<string id="2059" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It's fun to look for tracks, but you have to be careful! The mischievous spirits of the forest can deceive everyone, including experienced hunters — they'll leave all sorts of tracks to make you run around in circles, and then you'll get lost in the thicket!</string>
<string id="2060" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">If you come across bear tracks, you won't mistake them for anything — they even resemble human tracks a tiny bit. They are round and have five toes, but each toe ends with a dagger as long as a human palm!</string>
<string id="2061" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a closer look at the ground — it seems as though you have noticed boar tracks. They are elongated and split in two, like grains of wheat. But these are rather old.</string>
<string id="2062" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see marks of sharp claws on trees — a bear must have had real fun marking its territory. Now you have to be vigilant wherever you go.</string>
<string id="2063" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see that the leaves are trampled, but you cannot discern any tracks. You should examine trees for tracks — you might find a mark on the bark or a tuft of wool on one of the branches.</string>
<string id="2064" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You trip over a protruding branch and fall forward, landing right on your face. Your knees are raw and your forehead is injured. (knockdown)</string>
<string id="2065" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something that resembles dog tracks on the ground. What would a dog be doing here? It's a wolf! You remember tales about humans that can turn into wolves — those are a great deal more dangerous to come across than actual wolves.</string>
<string id="2066" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see old grain-like tracks on the ground. It's a boar! But they are stretched into a single line — the beast must have been in a hurry. Who was following it?</string>
<string id="2067" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You inspect the grass you see. If the grains were eaten tidily, it must have been a bear. Boars chew quickly and sloppily — they eat on the run.</string>
<string id="2068" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You seem to have found wolf tracks. Ah well — a single wolf is no danger in the forest, for it will always try to pass a human by. But if you run into a pack during the winter, you're a goner!</string>
<string id="2069" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The silence is broken by a sudden crack of a twig. You shiver and stand still. Which forest animal could have broken it? Oh, it was your foot…</string>
<string id="2070" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look out for tracks, musing on which animal is the most dangerous — a bear, or a wounded boar? The battle that plays out in your head always ends the same way — the hunter gets torn to pieces.</string>
<string id="2071" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Bears are more intelligent than many a human being! They mess their tracks up so much you can hardly find them. The hunters said it can also attract a moose with a cry that resembles that of a female moose, and pull fishermen's nets out onto the shore. A most cunning beast indeed!</string>
<string id="2072" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Apart from looking around constantly, you keep smelling the wind. For instance, boar droppings have a sharp unpleasant smell — you'll be able to feel it from the distance of twenty feet.</string>
<string id="2073" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It's best to avoid meeting an irate boar face to snout. And in the winter they fashion themselves armor out of tree resin — that's when they're at their most furious and hard-sided.</string>
<string id="2074" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see tracks of large clawed paws, but they suddenly stop as if by magic. What unknown powers could have borne the beast away? Or have the forest spirits tricked you by making you run around in circles? You spit across your shoulder for the mirage to disappear.</string>
<string id="2075" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see torn-off bark high above your head. "What a giant!" you think to yourself. It's best to avoid a bear like that. Or, perhaps, it wasn't a bear in the first place.</string>
<string id="2076" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You keep your eyes on the ground, taking in the powerful and inapproachable atmosphere of the forest. This is where one's proximity to the spirits of nature is felt the most acutely.</string>
<string id="2077" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Blood drips from your knife as you take a satisfied look at the fruits of your labor — the most important thing here is to bleed the carcass well. That requires delivering a precise strike to the heart or slashing the main blood vessels. That's something you can do very aptly, after all.</string>
<string id="2078" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten wearily, thinking this is exactly what your father had taught you: move the knife across the belly, from the head to the tail, with a steady hand. Then make circles around the neck and the limbs — it's easier to skin the carcass that way. Good job!</string>
<string id="2079" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You're looking at the skinned carcass thinking which part of it to bury in the ground to placate God. Heart will probably be best — it embodies life itself, after all.</string>
<string id="2080" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are pleased with your work — you didn't waste any time with the carcass. After all, it's imperative that you get to business immediately, as soon as the spark of life leaves the body. Otherwise the meat might go stale.</string>
<string id="2081" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carefully wipe the knife with a tuft of grass. The knife is your closest ally. If you need to butcher and skin a carcass, you need to choose the sharpest knife you have. A dull one won't make it through the ribs. Nor will it cut tough meat — that of a moose, for instance.</string>
<string id="2082" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You put your knife back in its place and think that sometime you need all your skill to skin an animal. If you need the skin to be whole, you have to be very careful — especially from the side of the snout. You need to touch the skull with the knife very gently, as though you were kissing it, and the eyelids need to be pulled down, lest they get damaged.</string>
<string id="2083" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think you heard a hissing sound when you were cutting the meat. You inspect the carcass carefully — if you pierce the stomach with your knife, the meat may spoil instantly.</string>
<string id="2084" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop for a breather, remembering the way they hunted back home. If you went far on your hunt, you wouldn't be able to bring just any beast back. Hunters would use their knives with great skill to separate the meat from the bones so as not to break their backs. They would bring the meat home and bury the bones in the ground.</string>
<string id="2085" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You inspect the butchered carcass with pleasure — you've done well; the bladder is right here, and it's completely undamaged. There are hunters of poor skill who would empty everything into the meat — the guts as well as the bladder.</string>
<string id="2086" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You drop the knife on the ground and inspect your palm, which you have sliced with your knife in haste. It is all covered in blood — yours as well as the animal's, which makes it impossible for you to tell just how big the wound is.</string>
<string id="2087" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have finished work and were just about to stand up when you noticed a scar on the skin — a bald patch without any fur. You trace out the mark with your finger — it looks as though it had been left by an arrow.</string>
<string id="2088" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at your bloodied hands thinking just how cruel this world is to its children — everyone has to eat somebody else to survive. Then you shrug: it's either eat or be eaten, after all. And being eaten is much worse any way you look at it.</string>
<string id="2089" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You weren't very tidy when you were skinning the carcass, since you were trying to accomplish it before the deathly chill sets in. Once the carcass chills, it becomes much harder to skin it.</string>
<string id="2090" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an unpleasant sensation on your face — blood had squirted on it when you were cutting one of the major arteries. Now it has dried up and formed a scab-like patch on your skin.</string>
<string id="2091" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wipe the sweat from your brow with a bloodied hand, trying to catch your breath. You remember the two traditional ways of skinning a carcass. The skin of a deer's or a moose's carcass is peeled off as a single sheet, but when you skin a hare, you have to roll it up inside out.</string>
<string id="2092" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rest, recollecting one of the customs of the nomadic tribes that used to roam along the Empire's borders. Even within the Empire you find people who call beef and goat meet black, presuming it to be of low quality. They prefer to slaughter rams and horses for their meals.</string>
<string id="2093" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wipe your knife thinking of how aptly the steppe dwellers butcher animal carcasses. They don't cut bone — instead, they slice the carcass where its joints are. You slash it a few times and that's that!</string>
<string id="2094" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You barely manage to get up and you wipe your brow. This wasn't one of your better days, and it has taken you longer than usual to take care of the carcass</string>
<string id="2095" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a good look at the construction site. You chuckle inside — there was a time when the foundation of any house had to have blood sprinkled over it. The tradition is dying out — besides, the state religion does not condone human sacrifice. But modern builders occasionally slaughter a lamb at the construction site, at any rate. It's safer that way.</string>
<string id="2096" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a folk belief — if a builder harbors ill thoughts against someone, he puts a spell on a stone or a log in the new house. There is no worse curse, and nothing can save the unfortunate.</string>
<string id="2097" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember that back in the days of yore they would bury some poor soul alive when they built a palace or a fortress. Right in the foundation. Their spirit was supposed to guard the townsfolk or the owner of the castle from the enemies.</string>
<string id="2098" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of all the different methods of construction. Back in the day there were houses with earthen walls. All you need to do is to tamp it down as much as you can.</string>
<string id="2099" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember what your father always used to say: "There must be a solid foundation under any endeavor." So true. And especially true of buildings.</string>
<string id="2100" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that building a house is like making a living creature. And the power in your hands matches that of the gods, who grant the gift of life.</string>
<string id="2101" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the ground under your feet — you appear to have made no mistake. It doesn't crumble, and it isn't damp, so the ground waters must be running deep. So you have chosen a safe place, after all.</string>
<string id="2102" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch a tree with your hand and think of the old custom that trees for building should be felled in the winter — while the tree sleeps, all of its water is sucked into the ground.</string>
<string id="2103" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You also think that forefathers would never permit anyone to use unlucky trees for construction works — those split in two by lighting, for example, or the ones felled by the wind. Stands to reason — who knows what effect it could have on your house?</string>
<string id="2104" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the construction site and think with satisfaction that you have chosen a good place. Not at a crossroads, not at the site of a fire, and not at a graveyard.</string>
<string id="2105" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You scratch the back of your head wondering whether you may have been too hasty with the construction. After all, back in the olden days they would call in diviners, who would observe the flight of birds or toss some sheep bones around to find the best place for construction.</string>
<string id="2106" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your grandfather would put coins into the foundation for prosperity. And if you put bread in every corner, the residents will never go hungry in their life.</string>
<string id="2107" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You press your palm against the tree — it seems warm. You think that the larch is the best tree for construction. It is sturdy and durable, and lasts many decades. However, you haven't seen any hereabouts.</string>
<string id="2108" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wonder what kind of timber you should use for the top of the building. Tastes differ, but your favorite wood comes from aspens. They are easy to chop and resilient to rain; the wood sparkles with gold in the sun and with crimson at sunset.</string>
<string id="2109" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Tell me what you will, but I prefer coniferous trees to their deciduous counterparts, whatever they are. The timber is strong and resistant to moisture. The silver fir, for instance, has a pleasant smell; it also keeps you warm better than any other tree.</string>
<string id="2110" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You shave off a thin layer of wood and examine the shaving. Is it supple enough? Can you tie it into a knot? If it crumbles into dust, the wood is finally mature and dry enough. That is why they also keep timber under canopies — to expose them to the wind that will blow all the moisture out of them.</string>
<string id="2111" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Wood is easier to use in construction, of course. Stone is more trouble, but it keeps warmth inside during the winter and coolness in the summer.</string>
<string id="2112" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Wood makes the habitation smell better; on the other hand, neither fire, nor rain can do anything to stone. Fancy someone try to destroy you when you hide behind stone walls!</string>
<string id="2113" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you truly shouldn't skimp on construction materials — the thicker the wall, the sturdier and the more reliable it is. And in these troubled times one has to think of protection first.</string>
<string id="2114" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think there will not be enough stone and lumber for building a house with proper framework. What you need is a mixture of clay and hay or dry rush, depending on where you live.</string>
<string id="2115" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you are a different person when you're hungry, and it's best not to stand in your way — you could eat a whole moose with his skin right now.</string>
<string id="2116" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swallow a bite and feel it drop down into the greedy and empty stomach that contracts in anticipation of food.</string>
<string id="2117" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Oh, this is a far cry from my dear mom's cooking. That was no food — that was nectar! The golden juices of the meat would trickle down the chin; the fingers and the face would be covered in grease, and the smell was so powerful you could cut it with a knife and put slices in your mouth.</string>
<string id="2118" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Not the kind of food one dreams of right now. Oh, for a fat chunk of pork, or even a young lamb — fresh from the spit, hot and smoky…</string>
<string id="2119" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The bite you take in haste gets stuck in your throat and you convulsively try to cough it out and catch a breath. Your body is shaken by coughing spasms. The ill-fated chunk is finally out. You wipe the sweat from your brow.</string>
<string id="2120" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly there's an itch in your nose and you sneeze. Your full mouth is like a geyser spewing half-chewed food.</string>
<string id="2121" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">There is a wasp buzzing around your lips, attracted by the smell of food. You try to wave the pesky insect away, and it retaliates by biting you in the lip. You find that it isn't that easy to chew when your lip is swallen.</string>
<string id="2122" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A meal is always a good thing. Still, I hope I won't get stomach cramps like the previous time. All the innards felt like they were being turned inside out, as if the very soul was about to have a rendezvous with the ancestors come morning.</string>
<string id="2123" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swallow the food greedily. Your teeth grind and tear it. One of your cheeks suddenly gets in between your teeth, which work as grindstones. You jerk your head in sudden pain and are forced to chew with more care, trying to favor the damaged side and avoid having food touch it.</string>
<string id="2124" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A piece of food gets into one of your teeth, and it feels as if it were struck by lightning. You grab your cheek — the tooth worm must be as hungry as you, devouring your flesh greedily.</string>
<string id="2125" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Finally you truly understand the wise words of your mother: "Hunger is the best seasoning to any food."</string>
<string id="2126" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden weakness in your body, and a sweat comes onto your brow. "Those were some cramps," you think, hoping fervently that, perhaps, at least this time the illness will pass you by.</string>
<string id="2127" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a loud rumble in your intestines. Well, what can you say? A hungry belly has no ears and heeds no words. The only language one's stomach understands is the language of food.</string>
<string id="2128" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swallow a bite with satisfaction, without having even chewed it properly, and remember an old saying: the stomach is an ingrate and remembers no good deeds. No point discussing yesterday's dinner with it.</string>
<string id="2129" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dally for a moment, wary of another stomach cramp. Then you open your mouth wide: whatever jumps into your mouth is good for you!</string>
<string id="2130" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it feels a lot better once you have dined, no matter how much you eat. And it feels warmer, too.</string>
<string id="2131" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You finish chewing the last bite and think that it's much better this way. You cannot stop that gaping hole in the stomach with anything — all you can do is give it food.</string>
